<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>When Denise of the Hermitage went down to draw
water at the spring at the edge of the beech wood, she
saw the light of a fire flashing out through the blue
gloom of the April dusk. It was far away—that fire,
almost on the horizon, a knot of tawny colour seen
between the dark slopes of two high hills. Yet though
it was so far away Denise could see the long flames
moving, sometimes shooting upwards, or bending and
sweeping towards the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise stood and watched these flames that waved
and flickered yonder through the dusk where the smoke
spread out between the hills into a kind of pearly haze.
It was so still under the boughs of the great beeches
that the distant fire seemed strange and ghostly, burning
without a sound. The little pool where Denise had filled
her pitcher was not more silent, the pool fed by an invisible
spring, and believed to be miraculous and holy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet though those far flames were so silent, Denise
could set a sound to them, a crackling roar that would
be very real to those who looked on the thing as on a
sacrifice. There would be many watchers on the hills
that night, sullen and silent folk to whom that blaze
would speak like a war cresset teased by the wind on
some great lord’s tower. Peter of Savoy’s riders, those
hired “spears” from over the sea, Gascons, Flemings,
Bretons, were out to keep the King’s peace in the Rapes
of Pevensey and of Hastings. Denise knew that private
war had been let loose, for had she not heard from the
priest of Goldspur, and from Aymery the manor lord,
that many of the lesser gentry and the Cinque Port towns
were calling for Earl Simon? The pot that had long
been simmering, had boiled over of a sudden. And
those who had scalded toes had only their own perversity
to thank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In such a fashion began the Barons’ war in many
a quiet corner of the land. Lawyers might orate and
scribble, but when men quarrelled over a great issue,
and the heart of a people was full of bitterness and
discontent, the rush was towards the primitive ordeal
of the sword. “God—and the King!”—“Earl Simon
and the Charter!” These two rallying cries cut off
brother from brother, and father from son. There had
been years of verbiage, oath breaking, famine, peculation,
and cynical corruption in high places. The law
was no law, the King’s oath a byword in brothels and
in taverns. The great Father—even the Pope—had had
both fists in the English money pots. Poitevins, Provençals,
and Italians had scrambled together. The
country was sick of it. Men who were in grim earnest
hastened to get to blows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Denise, half hermitess, half saint, went back
through the beech wood, the fire, like a great red brazier,
still shone out on her, latticed by the black boughs,
or hidden for a moment behind a tree bole. And though
the wood was as still and solemn as a temple, it seemed
full of a hushed and listening dread, waiting for the
wind that should come roaring through the tops of the
trees. Unrest was upon the hills, and in the deeps of
the valleys. Denise felt it as she might have felt the
nearness of thunder on a sultry night in June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But if no wind stirred in the wood that night, there
were other sounds more human and more passionate
than the voice of the wind. Denise had said her prayers
in her cell when the dead leaves under the beech trees
whispered with the moving of many feet. Indistinct
figures went in and out among the tree boles, the muttering
of voices mingling with the rustle of the leaves. A
full moon had risen, and begun to throw long slants of
light into the darkness of the wood, outlining the black
branches, and splashing the trunks of the trees with
silver. In and out, through the still moonlight and the
shadows, came the moving figures whose feet filled the
whole wood with the shiver of dead leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They straggled along by twos and threes, some silent
and morose, others talking with the quick muttering
intensity of men who have given and taken blows. A
darker core moved along the woodland path in the
midst of this scattered company. Men were carrying a
litter of boughs piled upon the trunks of two young ash
trees. The moonlight played intermittently upon the
men about the litter, showing so many white faces,
intent and silent, and a body that lay upon the bed of
boughs with a shield covering its face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A breadth of clear sky in the thick of the wood showed
them that they were close on the glade where Denise
of the Forest had her cell. The place was sacred and
full of mystery to the woodlanders of those parts, and
the scattered figures drew together under a tree where
the path came out of the wood into the glade. Only
the litter of boughs and the men with it went forward
into the moonlight; the rest held aloof like dogs left
by their master at the door of a church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men who carried the litter set it down outside
the gate in the wattle fence that shut in Denise’s garden.
There was some whispering, but the men’s voices were
no longer harsh and angry. Grimbald, the parish priest,
sent them back into the wood to wait. Two men remained
beside the litter, one standing a little apart with
a cloak wrapped round him, and a hood drawn forward
over his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald, the priest from Goldspur village, opened
the gate, and went up the path paved with rough, flat
stones that led to the cell. Denise had heard the sound
of voices, and the rustling of the dead leaves in the
wood. Grimbald’s voice warned her that they were
friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sancta Denise,” he said, crossing himself, “<span class='it'>ora
pro nobis</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door opened, under the broad black eaves of
the hermitage. Denise stood there on the threshold,
wearing a grey cloak that shone white in the light of
the moon. Her hair clouded past her shoulders to her
knees. It was miraculous hair, red as rust in the shade,
but burning in the sunlight with a sheen of gold. Denise
herself was miraculous, and this beech wood of hers
was said to be full of many marvels. People who came
for holy water from her pool, or to be treated by her
for sickness, swore that they had seen a moving radiance,
like a marsh fire, in the wood, and heard the voices of
angels and the murmur of their wings. Denise was
famed for her powers of healing. She knew all the
precious herbs, and the touch of her hands could bring
a blessing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald told her the news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Waleran de Monceaux’s lad,” he said. “Come
and see, Sanctissima, whether God will be merciful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent forward and looked into Grimbald’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is war with us—then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald spread his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peter of Savoy sent out his free-lances from Pevensey.
They were too strong for us. The lad was
shot through the body when they drove us into the
woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw a fire—about dusk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Waleran’s hall—and outhouses! That was the
end of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood aside, and Denise went down the path,
her bare feet making no sound upon the stones. Aymery,
lord of the manor of Goldspur, knelt in the grass beside
the litter holding the lad’s cold hands. Waleran still
stood aloof, his face hidden under his hood. No one
spoke to him. They left him alone, knowing his mood,
and the manner of man that he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise went on her knees beside the litter, her two
hands putting back the masses of her hair. Aymery
lifted the shield from the lad’s face. The sleeve of his
hauberk brushed against Denise’s cloak. She glanced
round at him, and their eyes smiled faintly at one
another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We brought the boy to you. The arrow drove
right through him. You can feel the point under his
tunic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise laid a hand over the lad’s heart. There was
not a flicker of movement there, but she could feel the
arrow’s head standing out a hand’s breadth beyond the
ribs. The lad must have died very quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is dead,” she said to the man at her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery was staring at the boy’s face. He turned,
and glanced meaningly at the figure that stood apart in
silent isolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Waleran,” he said in a whisper, “he would
not believe the worst.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise gave a little shudder of pity. Aymery turned,
and met her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray for the boy, Denise. What is death, but a
miracle! And an hour ago——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spread her hands helplessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, death is beyond me; I am not blessed with
so much power. Someone must tell him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pity of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she echoed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The pity of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A compassionate humility made her bow her head
over the rough litter, for there was no place for the
smaller remembrance of self in the conscious awe of
her own helplessness. Denise had healed sick people,
but she who could play the lady of healing, knew herself
human in the presence of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him,” she said, “it is almost shame to me that
you should have brought the boy here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery covered the lad’s face again with the shield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray for Waleran,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the living rather than the dead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery rose and joined Grimbald the priest, who
was standing by the gate. Denise still knelt beside the
litter, holding the dead boy’s hands. And if compassion
could have given him life, compassion for that silent
man who stood aloof, life might have flowed miraculously
from Denise’s body, and spread like fire into the limbs
of the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald left Aymery, and crossed the grass to where
Waleran stood, Waleran that sturdy man with the fierce
red shock of hair. Waleran had been the first mesne
lord in those parts to bristle his mane against Count
Peter of Savoy. This hardihood had lost him his only
child, and made a bonfire of his home, though he would
not believe at first that the boy was dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery of Goldspur turned again to Denise. He
could see that she was praying, and his eyes, that were
frosty with the cold anger of a strong man helpless in
the face of death, flashed suddenly as he saw the moonlight
touching Denise’s hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald had Waleran by the shoulders. They heard
a short, sharp oath scatter the priest’s whisperings as a
puff of wind scatters a handful of feathers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was the sound of heavy breathing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me alone! Am I a fool of a girl?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience, brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Patience be cursed! What is the use of an idiot
saint if an arrow between the ribs is too much for her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise let the boy’s hands fall; Aymery saw her
bow her head, and heard her whisper words that he could
not catch. Then Waleran came forward, swinging his
arms as though to keep off Grimbald who towered beside
him like a great ship. Waleran stopped at the foot of
the litter, and stood staring at the shield that covered
the dead boy’s face. Some impulse drove him to his
knees, and he began to feel for the arrow, breathing
heavily through set teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s nearness seemed to come between him and
the savage tenderness of a dog for its dead whelp. Her
humility and her compassion were not tuned to the cry
of nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up,” he said. “This is my affair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He leant forward, and pushed her back with a rough
thrust of the open hand. Aymery caught Denise, and
drew her aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His arms lingered about her like the arms of a lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, I understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That arrow has stricken two hearts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes looked into Aymery’s as he let her go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God have pity,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Waleran had broken off the head of the arrow. He
held it up in the moonlight, and his hood fell back from
his face. The three who watched him saw his face
contorted with laughter, though no sound came from
the open mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ran the arrow’s head through his cloak, as a woman
pins her tunic with a splinter of bone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is a keepsake,” he said. “Lord, but I shall
cherish it! They have lit a candle for the boy, yonder.
Some day I shall hang a bell on a rope, and ring him a
passing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He scrambled up, swaggering, and shaking his
shoulders. It was his way of carrying the burden that
the night had laid on him. He shouted to the men,
roughly, and they came out from the shadows of the
trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had lifted the litter, Waleran jerked
himself on to it, and putting the shield aside, sat fingering
his boy’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A puff of wind, and the candle is out,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The litter swayed under his weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spill me, you fools, and I shall have something to
say to you. Off with you. To-morrow we must put
this poor pigeon under the grass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men moved away, and Grimbald would have
followed them, but Waleran ordered him back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I nothing better to do than to cut my own
throat!” he said. “Shifts and cassocks are no good
for me. The puppy is mine, by God! Let no one
meddle between him and me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald followed them no farther, and heard the
swish of their feet die away through the dead leaves into
the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an hour from their first coming the beech wood
was silent and empty, and Denise’s cell lay with its dark
thatch like an islet in the midst of a quiet mere. Not
a ripple of sound played over the surface of the night.
Aymery and Grimbald had gone to warn their own
people that death was abroad on the White Horse. And
Denise, sitting on her bed, wakeful, and filled with a
great pity for Waleran and the lad, felt that the stealthy
glamour of the moonlight was cold and unreal. If her
compassion followed Waleran, a feeling more deep and
more mysterious followed Aymery under the boughs of
the beeches. Yet this feeling of Denise’s was as miraculous
as the moonlight which she thought so cold and
mute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men made their way through the wood by
a broad green ride, and stood listening where the heathland
began for any sound that might steal out of the vast
silence of the night. Grimbald’s great head, with its
gaunt, eagle face, the colour of smoked oak, had the
full moon behind it for a halo. Aymery of Goldspur
stood a little below him on the hillside, leaning on his
sword. His thoughts were back among the trees about
Denise’s glade, those towering trees whose boughs seemed
hung with the stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Below them stretched wastes of whin and heather,
hills black with forests, valleys full of moonlit mist.
They could see the sea shining in the distance, a whole
land beneath them, ghostly, strange, and still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is all quiet yonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald’s head was like the head of a hawk, alert
and very watchful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have done enough for one night,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To make us keep troth with the King!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both were silent for a moment. Grimbald spoke
the thought that was uppermost in Aymery’s mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is no longer safe for the girl alone, yonder,” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery, that man with the iron mouth and the square
chin, and eyes the colour of the winter sea, spread his
shoulders as an archer spreads them before drawing a
six-foot bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will see to it,” he said quietly. “Nothing must
happen to Denise.”</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The little red spider of a man who pattered along beside
Gaillard’s horse, looked up from time to time into the
Gascon’s face, and thought what a great pageant life
must be to a soldier who had such a body and so much
pay. For the little red spider was a cripple, and nothing
more glorious than a spy, a thing that crawled like a
harvest bug, and might have been squashed without
ceremony under the Gascon’s fist. As for Gaillard he
was a very great man, cock and captain of Count Peter’s
chickens, those most meek birds who scratched up obstinate
worms, and kept their lord’s land clean of
grubs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were marching back to Pevensey, bows and
spears, along the flat road over the marshes, with the
downs in the west a dull green against the April sky.
Waleran de Monceaux had been chastened in proper
fashion, a chastening that might calm the turbulent
tempers of his neighbours. Of what use were such castles
as Pevensey, Lewes, Arundel, and Bramber, to the King
at such a crisis, if the great lords did not put pettifogging
law aside and coerce as much of the country as they could
cover with their swords? Men were tired of words and
of charters. “Let us come to grips,” said they, “and
not quarrel over parchment and seals.” And the great
lords were wise in their necessity, kept—each in his
castle—a dragon at his service, a dragon that could be
sent out to scorch up those who had the temerity to
threaten the King.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little red spider thought Messire Gaillard a fine
fellow. He had such limbs on him, such a voice, such a
cheerful way of bullying everyone. The Gascon might
have been made of brown wire, he was so restless, so
sinewy, so alert; a rust-coloured man with red and uneasy
eyes, a harsh skin blotched with freckles, hair that curled
like a negro’s, and a big mouth insolent under the aggressive
tusks of its moustache. A vain man, too, as his
dress and his harness showed, a man who put oil on his
hair, wore many rings, and had a quick eye for a woman.
He was just the lusty, headstrong animal, a born fighter,
and a bully by instinct, inflammable, self-sufficient, a
babbler, and a singer of love songs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waters of the bay were covered with purple
shadows, and the marshlands brilliant as green samite
when Gaillard’s men came to the western gate of the
castle, and rode two by two with drooped spears into the
great outer bailey closed in by the old Roman walls.
Gaillard came last, with the spy pattering beside his
horse. The men went to their quarters, rough pent
houses that had been built for them along the northern
wall, for there was not room enough in Peter of Savoy’s
new castle within a castle for all those hired men from
over the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pevensey would have astonished any rough Northumbrian
baron, or the fiery Marcher Lords who fought
the Welsh. For Peter of Savoy was a southerner, a
compeer of the King’s in his love of colour and of music.
To dig a moat and build white towers was not enough
for him, and the spirit of Provence had emptied itself
within the Roman wall. A great part of the space had
become a garden, shut in with thickets of cypresses and
bays. The roses of Provence bloomed there in June.
Winding alley ways went in and out, short swarded, and
overhung by rose trees. There were vines on trellises,
and banks of fragrant herbs. In the thick of a knoll of
cypresses Count Peter kept two leopards in a cage, yellow-eyed
beasts which glided silently to and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard, skirting the cypresses of the pleasaunce, had
his eyes on the window of the great tower where Peter of
Savoy loved to sit playing chess with Dan Barnabo his
chaplain, or listening to a woman singing to the lute.
The lutanist sang to others as well as to Count Peter.
Gaillard the Gascon knew the twitter of her strings,
better perhaps, than Peter of Savoy himself.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The words were those of Etoile of the Lute, and
Gaillard hummed them under the shade of the cypresses
as he rode towards the inner gate. But some hand
threw a clod of turf at him that morning, and threw it so
cleverly that the thing hit Gaillard on the ear, and
spattered his blue surcoat over with soil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Gascon turned sharply in the saddle, and saw
a white hand showing between two cypress trees, and a
wrist that betrayed the golden threads embroidering a
woman’s sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A voice laughed at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The arm put the boughs aside, and a face appeared,
wreathed by the cypress sprays, a woman’s face, white,
mischievous, and alluring. Her black hair was bound
up in a golden net. She showed her teeth at Gaillard,
and put out the tip of a red tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I throw straight, dear lord?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his horse, glanced at the window in the
tower, and then laughed back at her, opening his mouth
wide like the beak of a hungry bird.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better at a man’s heart, than at his head, dear
lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Gascon has more head than heart, my friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a long sword, and a longer tongue!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tilted her chin, two black eyes laughing above
a short, impudent nose, and a hard, red mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and have your gossip with good Peter. Barnabo
has beaten him twice at chess, and he was ready to throw
the board at me. The leopards are better tempered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard snapped his fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be a leopard,” he said. “Wait till I have
washed the dust off. Peter always plays until he wins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white face disappeared behind the cypress boughs,
and Gaillard rode on to his quarters, ready to wash the
dust of the road away with wine and water, and thinking
of Etoile, Count Peter’s lutanist and lady. She was a
Gascon also from the land of the Garonne. Etoile and
Gaillard were excellent friends, especially when the
Savoyard was playing chess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were peacocks strutting in the garden, sunning
their gorgeous tails, when Gaillard fresh from the bath
and the hands of his man, went out to Etoile among the
cypresses. At the window above Peter of Savoy had
his head over the chess-board. The game was such a
passion with him, that his people left him in the throes
of it, not even Etoile being allowed to touch her lute.
The Savoyard, chin on the palm of his left hand, with
Barnabo opposite him, had not so much as noticed
Gaillard’s return. The men had ridden to their quarters,
but Peter’s long fingers loitered over the board, and his
ears might have been stuffed with wool. Barnabo,
who had won two games, had enough worldly wisdom
behind his smooth, Italian face to know that the time
had come to put his lord in a happier temper. Barnabo
always rose from the board a loser. It was part of his
policy to pique the great man by defeating him at first,
that he might delight him the more with the inevitable
revenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are too subtle for me, sire,” he would confess.
“I can begin by winning, that is easy. When I have
beaten you, you laugh, and turn to show me what a
child I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chess-players were so intent above, that Gaillard
and the lute girl Etoile, had the half hour safely to themselves.
They were blood cousins—these two Gascons,
and yet nearer of kin in the intimate ambition that had
sent them hunting in a strange land. How the Lady
of the Peacocks had persuaded Peter of Savoy into
loving her would be a tale fit for a French song. She
could do very much as she pleased with him so long as
he was not hanging his dyed beard over the chess-board.
As for her and Gaillard, they understood one another.
The man was driven at times to be rash and impetuous.
Etoile was strange and fierce enough at a crisis to keep
Gaillard’s galloping passion from breaking its own neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These two Gascons had a common enemy, Barnabo
the Italian, who was as clever as Etoile, and far more
clever than Gaillard. The chaplain was a smooth man,
a man who smiled when he was snubbed, and put the
insult carefully into the counting-house of his memory.
There was sometimes a glitter in his eyes, like the gleam
of a knife hidden in a sleeve. He hated Etoile, and Etoile
the woman, knew why he hated her. Barnabo would
have had her for an accomplice, the Queen on the chess-board
to play against Count Peter. Etoile had struck
Barnabo across the face, and the chess-board and the
lute had been at feud with one another. Peter of Savoy
knew nothing of all this. Both Barnabo and Etoile were
too wise to throw soot at one another, unless the
chance should come when one could be safely blackened
without so much as a pinch of slander falling upon the
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was of Barnabo they talked that morning, hidden
by the cypresses, Etoile standing by the leopards’ cage,
the great beasts fawning against the bars, and letting her
stroke their heads. There seemed some sympathy between
her and the two sleek, sinuous cats. The voice and the
eyes of Etoile cast a spell upon them. They would purr
and rub against the bars when she came near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady of the Peacocks told Gaillard a piece of
news that made the man’s eyes grow more hard and
restless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had better not meddle,” he said; “or I will
twist his neck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etoile snapped her fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a great fool, my Gaillard, Barnabo is not
so rough and clumsy. I know the man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the rat is nibbling at our cheese!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else can he do, the Savoyard cannot go to
bed with him. A man is at a disadvantage. He can
only call names.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behind our backs, my desire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Over the chess-board, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard put a hand through the bars, and scratched a
leopard’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a pity,” he said, “that we cannot shut Barnabo
up with these two innocents when they are hungry.
They would play a pretty game with him, a game of
knucklebones, with nothing left afterwards but some
rags, two sandals, and a brain box.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etoile laughed, and then looked shrewd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are other people who would eat up Dan
Barnabo, people in the woods—yonder. Every man has
a foolish corner in his heart. If Barnabo asks you how
the country seems, tell him the folk are as frightened as
mice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very lusty mice, my desire! Call them pole-cats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pole-cats may serve as well as leopards. Be careful
of that window in the tower; Barnabo has quick eyes.
Go up now and see how the game goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter of Savoy and the chaplain still had the chess-board
between them when Gaillard went up to the room
in the tower. The window, widely splayed, had painted
medallions in its frames. A song book and a lute lay
on a red cushion, with a gaze-hound curled on the seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third game was nearly at an end, and Peter of
Savoy was rubbing his pointed beard, and chuckling
inwardly as he hung over the board. Barnabo brooded,
his puzzled, hesitating hands flattering the strategy of
his lord and opponent. Gaillard sat down on the window
seat to wait. Peter of Savoy was to triumph. Therefore
the world went well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A resigned sigh from Barnabo, the tap of a piece on
the board, a shuffling of Count Peter’s feet, and the end
came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great man sat back, laughed in his chaplain’s
face, and turned a sharp and self-satisfied profile to
Gaillard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you are back, my Gascon. All our games have
gone well, have they? See—I am about to steal his
lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard leant forward to watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since he is a priest, sire, you are saving him from
great temptation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter of Savoy laughed, but for some reason Barnabo
looked up at the Gascon sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The game was lost and won, and Gaillard had told
his news. Peter of Savoy had picked up the lute, and
was twanging the strings complacently. Barnabo still
pored over the chess-board as though to discover how
and where he had been beaten. He was a clever artist
in the conception of flattery, yet he was on the alert
while Peter of Savoy and Gaillard talked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiet as lambs, to be sure. That will be good
news for our friend here. You smoked Waleran out like
a fox out of a hole. Excellent Gascon! Fire purifies,
so thought the Greeks. There are the folk at Goldspur
to be seized—unless they come in with halters round their
necks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great man hummed a passage from a favourite
song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barnabo would not be persuaded,” he said, half-closing
his eyes slyly. “You must know, my Gaillard,
that Barnabo is a man with a hot conscience. He has
learnt six words of English—what does that matter?
So many benefices to be served—in Latin; so many
women to be shrived! Even when the wolves are out—Barnabo
will not neglect his duties!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Italian was imperturbable and debonair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a charm against all wolves,” he said, looking
at Gaillard out of the corner of his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your sanctity, Father, to be sure. Most excellent
St. Francis, the hawks even perch on your shoulders.
Barnabo will mount his mule and ride out to comfort
the sick, whatever I, his lord, may say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard took the gaze-hound up into his lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will have nothing to fear there, now. I will
answer for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barnabo’s eyes were studying Gaillard’s face. He
smiled, and began to gather up the chess-men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After the sword come the Cross and the mass book,”
he said. “You will not quarrel with my conscience, sire,
if I ride out to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who—in Christendom—is worth the labour of a
quarrel? Command your friends, and tread upon your
enemies. Go out, and heal the sick, when the husbands
are not at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etoile, who had been listening at the door, pulled
Gaillard into a dark corner on the stairs when he came
out to see to the guards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So Barnabo is going a-love-making,” she said.
“Good. Perhaps he will not come back again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she sang to Peter of Savoy that night, a desirable
woman whose face betrayed no care.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was so much the saint and the Lady of the
Goldspur woods that the country folk had almost ceased
to wonder whence she had come, and what her past had
been. She was Sancta Denise to them, a woman to
whom they went when they were sick or in trouble, who
came and prayed for them, and smiled on their children
with her miraculous eyes. All the woodland folk in the
hundreds round looked on Denise as a saint, a child of
mystery who dwelt up yonder amid the great beech trees
under the clouds. Offerings were left before her gate,
milk, bread, eggs, and herbs, the offerings of the poor.
If there was digging to be done, or the grass to be scythed
in the glade, some of Aymery’s villeins would be there at
dawn, working like brown gnomes in the dusk of the
breaking day. Four times a year a pedlar brought her
the gold thread for her orfrays work, for Denise had
wonderful hands, and her embroidery had been worn
by queens. The money that she earned Denise spent
among the poor, and she might have walked from Rye
to Shoreham, and no Sussex man would have laid hands
upon her, save to touch her gown for a blessing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia, Aymery’s mother, alone had known Denise’s
history, and Olivia was dead. Some had said that she
was the “love child” of a great lady, others a “ward”
who had fled from the King’s court rather than be married
to some creature who had offered the King money. But
Denise was Denise, and her past was of no account,
though any hind could have sworn that she was no
peasant’s child. The cell in the beech wood had been
built for her by Dame Olivia, and the ground about it
turned into a garden. Denise had become part of the
woodland life, a tender and mysterious figure that threw
a glamour over the hearts of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her coming had been soon after the great famine,
when the crops had failed after a wet summer. Death
had passed over the land like a plague, and in the towns
the dead had lain for days unburied. The famine had
left sickness behind it, sick women, and sick babes at
the breast, as though the whole countryside had grown
feeble for lack of bread. Denise had come down from
her cell in the beech wood, a veritable Lady of Compassion.
It was not the bread that she had given, but
the pity and the tenderness that had enshrined her in the
hearts of all the people. It was as though she had magic
power, a glory given of God and the Virgin. Men soon
spoke of miracles. Sick children were brought to her,
and water taken from her holy spring. The abbots and
priors of the south heard of her, and more than one
“house” considered the value that might be set upon
a saint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps Denise’s power lay largely in her youth,
for she was no ulcerous and lean recluse, but a woman
in the morning of her beauty, a beauty that was strange
and elfin-like, rich as an autumn in red leaf. She had
but to look at men, and they felt an awe of her; at
children, and they came to her like birds to a witch.
The hair under the grey hood had the colour of copper,
with tinges of red and of gold. Her eyes were between
amber and the brown of a woodland pool, her skin so
clear and white, despite the sun and the wind, that men
believed her heart could be seen shining like a red gem
beneath. Denise was tall, and broad across the bosom.
Her fingers were so long, and slim, and white, that the
superstitious believed that pearls might drop from them,
and that not even the brown soil of her garden could
cling to those miraculous hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise carried her pitcher to the spring the morning
after they had brought Waleran’s boy to her with an
arrow through his heart. She stripped herself at the
pool, and washed her body, scooping up the water in her
palms, her hair knotted over her neck. Denise’s naked
figure might have stood as the symbol of her womanhood,
clean, comely, unshadowed by self-consciousness. It
was part of the infinite mystery of things, a mystery
that dwelt in Denise’s heart, and gave her power over
women and over men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brown eyes were sad that morning as she slipped
on her white shift and her grey gown, and went back
under the beech trees to her cell. With the fragrance
of the wild flowers and the dew came the consciousness
of the rougher world within that world of hers. She
remembered the flames of the night before, Waleran’s
dead boy, the savage anguish of the man breaking out
into bitterness and laughter. What more might not
happen in the deeps of the woods? Denise was no
ignorant child, she had lived in another world before
Olivia had built her the cell under the Goldspur beeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise said her prayers, worked awhile in her garden,
and then brought out her orfrays of gold, and sat in the
doorway under the deep shade of the thatch. But though
her fingers were busy with the threads, her mind was
full of a spirit of watchfulness and of unrest. She felt
as it were the stir and movement of another world beyond
the towering domes of the trees. She had a premonition
that someone would come through the wood that morning.
It would be a man, and yet not Grimbald. Denise’s
hands were idle awhile, and her brown eyes looked thoughtfully
into the deeps of the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was it very wonderful that Aymery’s thoughts
should turn towards Denise as a man struggles through
the thick of a crowd when he sees a beloved head in danger.
He and Grimbald had been at the burying of Waleran’s
boy, but Aymery had left Grimbald and the rest, and
ridden back to Goldspur to see Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trampling of his horse’s hoofs through the dead
beech leaves came as no surprise to the woman who sat
with the orfrays work of gold in her lap. She had watched
her own mind, till, like a crystal, it had been full of the
man’s coming. Often in her life Denise had been able
to foresee the faces of those dear to her, and to feel friends
near while they were still far distant. She had the gift
of inward vision, though the power became lost to her
later when she had suffered many humiliations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery rode out into the sunlight of the glade, and
Denise could see that he was armed. A surcoat of apple
green covered the ringed hauberk, though the hood of
mail was turned back between his shoulders. Aymery
rode his big black destrier that day, and not the rough
nag he used for hawking and cantering over his lands.
He looped the bridle over the post at the gate, and came
up the path with the air of a man who has more in his
heart than his lips might utter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise let her work lie idle in her lap. She had had
no fear of Aymery from the first, his face had become so
familiar that it seemed part of the life round her, like the
trees, or the hills, or the distant sea. Yet from the instant
that he opened the wattle gate that morning, a sense
of strangeness took hold of both of them. Each felt
the change and wondered at it, so simple in its significance,
and yet so strange. The shadow of a cloud lay over them
for the first time. The more intimate hour had come
when the man looked into the woman’s eyes and thought
that thought which opens the eyes of the soul—“if
any harm should befall her! If that dear head should
suffer shame!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have buried the boy,” he said. “That will be
the beginning of a long tale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something satisfying about Aymery, a
man who carried his head high, and looked fearlessly
at the horizon. He had a quick yet quiet way with him
had Aymery of Goldspur. Shirkers and cowards were
afraid of those grey eyes of his, for they were not the eyes
of a man to be trifled with or fooled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke to Denise, resting his hands on his sword,
and looking at the golden orfrays work in her lap. She
was leaning against the door-post, her face in the shadow,
thought and feeling as intimately one as the rose and
the scent of the rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The woods are no longer safe. Peter of Savoy’s
riders will be with us again. Waleran will see to that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s brown eyes had a tremor of light in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you proved me a coward?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are cowards, Denise, where others are concerned.
What do the days promise us? Waleran could
not hold his house against those hired swarthies, nor can
I mine; I am not fool enough to doubt it. A few arrows
bearded with burning tow, the thatch alight, and the
smoke and the flames would make us run like rats. It
will be war in the woods where our bows can serve us,
and where their men-at-arms cannot ride our peasants
down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise did not answer him for a moment. Her hands
were turning over the embroidery in her lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have lived with you all in the sunshine,” she said.
“And now that trouble comes you would have me run
away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What man would not wish it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I am the worst of all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dropped her head suddenly as though hiding the
light and colour that had rushed into her eyes and face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not afraid,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am”—and he shut his lips on the words—“it
is human to be afraid. If you knew this scum of Gascons,
Flemings, and what not, you would wish them well
beyond the sea. Would to God that we could whip
them out of the land. But what would you! We cannot
pull down such a rock as Pevensey with our hands.
These castles that the King’s men hold for him are too
strong for us to meddle with. It is they who will do the
meddling, and what do these hired men care for what
we honour? You will be on the edge of a pit here.
Women are best away when swords are out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent towards her, looking down into her face,
his manhood shining out on her, strong and honest,
denying itself the right of a romantic beast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come with me, and I will guard you against all
Christendom.” A weaker and vainer man might have
spoken in such heroics. Aymery knew what he knew.
Denise would be safer away from him when such men as
Waleran were to be his brethren-in-arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you the truth, Denise, because——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up at him suddenly, and their eyes met.
Denise saw the deeper truth, that great mystery of
life that cannot hide itself from the eyes of a woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, what shall I say to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spread his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say nothing. Do what I, Grimbald, all, desire.
I have good friends at Winchelsea. You will be safe
there. The King wishes to win the Cinque Ports over.
He will not be rough with them, as yet. They are too
precious to be ravaged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise looked at the sky beyond the boughs of the
beech trees, letting her hands hang over her knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord,” she said, “I am still obstinate. I have
lived among you all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise, I also am obstinate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not have you otherwise. And yet, how
can I shirk the truth that I shall be deserting you all
the moment trouble comes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled at her, and shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Should we be the happier if you fell into the hands
of Peter of Savoy? No. That is unthinkable! I would
rather see you—dead like Waleran’s boy—before they
carried you into Pevensey! Good God, you, to be touched
by such hands!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise understood all that was in his heart. She
crossed herself as though against the evil things of the
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord,” she said, “let there be this promise
between us. If Goldspur is threatened, then—I will do
what you desire. When the people take to the woods,
I shall feel less of a coward. They shall not say that I
fled from a shadow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus it was agreed between them, Aymery riding
back through the woods towards Goldspur, the face of
Denise more wonderful to him than it had ever seemed
before. Aymery had come by the truth that morning,
and the world had a mystery—the mystery of the tenderness
of spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Close by Goldspur village, on the edge of the manor
ploughlands, he met Grimbald, who had come in search
of him. The priest’s face had the look of a stormy and
ominous sky. He took Aymery’s bridle, and turned back
with him towards the village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Waleran has gone towards Pevensey,” he said.
“We must be ready for a whirlwind when such storm-cocks
are on the wing.”</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A poor rag of a man, with the pinched face of a sick
girl, came limping on sore heels to the western gate of
Pevensey. The man had a broken arrow through the
flesh of his neck; his mouth was all awry, and his breath
came in great heaves, for he had run ten miles that
morning. When someone caught him round the middle
as he tottered at the gate, he doubled up like a wet
clout over a line, and emptied his very soul over the
stones. The guards put him on his back awhile, rubbed
his legs, and gave him a horn of mead to drink. One of
them forced the back of the arrow through the skin,
and whipped it out as a woman whips a broken bodkin
out of a friend’s finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The beer, and the blunt heroism of this barber surgeon
brought Barnabo’s man briskly upon his haunches. He
clapped his hand to his neck, saw that there was blood
on it, and promptly began to whimper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve pulled the spiggot out,” he wailed. “Lord,
did ever a hogshead gush faster! Linen—oil, and linen,
for the love of the Saints.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men laughed at him. One of them took a smock
that hung on a nail outside the porter’s lodge, tore a
strip from it, spat on the wound, and bandaged Barnabo’s
man till he had a gorget and whimple fit for a nun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take a little more beer, comrade,” he said. “Never
a rabbit ran more bravely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fugitive sulked under their attentive and jeering
faces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to perdition,” he retorted. “It was fifty to
one, there, in the woods. Messire Gaillard must hear of
it. You will all be very brave, sirs, when these devils
begin to shoot at you from behind a hundred trees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard heard of it soon enough, as did Etoile, and
Peter of Savoy. Barnabo had been waylaid in the woods
that morning, and the pole-cats had clawed him off his
mule. For no man was more hated than Dan Barnabo
in those parts, a hard, shrewd man who held many benefices,
and saw that his steward ground out the dues.
The Italian could not speak ten words in the vulgar tongue.
His ministrations would have been ridiculous had he
ever troubled his soul about the people. It was told that
a woman had once waylaid Barnabo, and demanded to
be shriven. The Italian had understood nothing of
what she said to him, but since she was pretty and importunate,
he had created a scandal by misunderstanding
her whole desire, and by seeking to comfort her in a
fashion that was not fatherly. The woman had scratched
Barnabo’s face. There were many people who had lusted
to scarify him more viciously. Barnabo baptised no
children, sought out none of the sick, buried none of
the dead. Twice a year perhaps he had said mass in
the churches that belonged to him. Few of the people
had come to hear Barnabo’s Roman voice. He was
a better lute player and lap-dog than priest, and the
people knew it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard had his orders from Peter of Savoy. Etoile
laughed in his face when she met him upon the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let the pole-cats play a little with Barnabo,” she
said. “Do not ride furiously, dear lord! I can learn
to serve at chess better than Barnabo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard caught at her, but she slipped past him up
the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are two sorts of fools in the world, my Gaillard,”
she said. “One is killed for the sake of a woman,
the other through greed for a woman. Keep out of
Barnabo’s path.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both Peter of Savoy and the Gascon knew whither
Barnabo had ridden that April day. It was notorious
that the Italian had kept a <span class='it'>focaria</span> or hearth-ward at a
priest’s house of his in a valley beyond the hill called
Bright Ling because of the glory of its heathlands in
the summer. The woman—a Norman—was more comely
than was well for Dan Barnabo’s name, and she had
kept the house for him, and rendered it to him sweet and
garnished whenever he chose to ride that way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard and his men marched past Dallington,
where Guillaume Sancto de Leodegario was lord of the
manor, and on over Bright Ling with the furze in full
bloom. The little red spy jogged along beside the Gascon’s
horse. He led them into a deep valley, a valley full of
the grey-green trunks of oak trees, and the brown wreckage
of last year’s bracken. A stream dived and winked in
the bottoms, and at the end of a piece of grassland the
thatch of the priest’s house shelved under the very
boughs of the oaks. No smoke rose from the place.
It seemed silent and deserted as Gaillard and his men
came trampling through the dead bracken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard’s eyes swept hillside and valley, for he was
shrewd enough to guess that many an alert shadow
had dogged them on the march that day. He dismounted,
sent his archers into the woods as scouts,
and taking the pick of his men-at-arms, marched up to
the silent house, holding his shield ready to catch any
treacherous arrow that might be shot from the dark
squints. A wooden perch shadowed the main entry,
and Gaillard saw that the door stood ajar, and that the
flagstones paving the porch were littered with rushes,
and caked with mud as though many feet had passed
to and fro over the stones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard pushed the door open with the point of his
sword. It gave to him innocently enough, and he
crossed the threshold, and stood staring at something
that the men behind him could not see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The place had the dimness of twilight, lit as it was
by the narrow lancets cut in the thickness of the wall.
Not three paces from Gaillard, their feet nearly touching
the floor, two bodies dangled on ropes from the black
beams of the roof. The face of the one was grey; of
the other, black and turgid; for one had died by the
sword, the other by the rope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The body with the black face was still twisting to
and fro as a joint twists on a spit before the fire. The
arms had been pinioned, and the man’s tongue been
drawn out, and the head of an arrow thrust through it.
The face could scarcely be recognised, but by the clothes
Gaillard knew him for Dan Barnabo, the Italian, lutanist,
lover, spoiler of the poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard touched the body. It was still warm. His
men were crowding in, peering over each other’s shoulders
so that the doorway was full of faces, shields, and swords.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard waved them back. He swung his sword,
struck at the rope that held Barnabo, and cut it so cleanly
that the body came down upon its feet. For a moment
it stood, poised there, before falling forward to hide its
black face in the rushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard looked at it a little contemptuously, thinking
of Etoile, and the rivalry between her and this thing
that had been a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only fools come by such a death,” he said. “A
dog’s death. This man had a woman’s hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dusk was falling, and Gaillard and his men settled
themselves to pass the night in dead Barnabo’s house
under the oak trees. Gaillard, who did not trouble
himself about such a thing as a “crowner’s quest,”
had the two bodies buried in the garden at the foot of
a holly tree. Waleran de Monceaux had hanged Barnabo,
and the priest was not pretty to look at with his black
face and his swollen tongue. Nor was Gaillard going
to quarrel with so convenient a coincidence. He called
his archers back out of the woods, posted two sentinels,
had the horses brought in and stabled in the hall. A fire
was lit on the hearth, and the men gathered round it,
and opened their wallets for supper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard kept the red-headed hunchback at his elbow,
and questioned him narrowly as to the woodways, and
the manor houses, and the gentry with whom he would
have to deal. These Sussex rebels had hanged Barnabo,
and in the hanging, thrown down the blood gauge to
Peter of Savoy. War was Gaillard’s business. He had
learnt the trade in Gascony, where neighbour went out
against neighbour as for a day’s hunting. Nor was it
Gaillard’s concern to trouble about the law of the land,
and how far feudal faith bound this man or that. The
King was the great over-lord, and Peter of Savoy stood
as his champion in those parts. Hence if rebels popped
their heads up, it was only necessary to strike with the
sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Night fell, and the men lay down to sleep in the
long hall, crowding about the fire, for the horses were
ranged along the walls. The air of the place was close
and heavy with the smoke from the fire, the animal
heat of the crowded bodies, and the pungent scent of
horses’ dung. Faint flickers of light lost themselves in
the black zenith of the timbered roof. Gaillard, sitting
propped in a corner with his sword across his knees,
could hear the wet murmur of the stream that ran close
to the house. He could also hear the two sentinels
answering each other, and since they seemed so whole-heartedly
alert, Gaillard dozed off like a dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About midnight Gaillard opened his eyes, and sat
staring at the dying fire, and though he remained motionless,
his face sharpened like the face of one who listens.
His eyes moved slowly from figure to figure, to rest at
last on the shutter closing a window. And Gaillard saw
that the shutter was shaking ever so little, and he knew
that there was no wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard did not move. He could hear a vague
scuffling as of many men moving about the house. But
there were other sounds that made the Gascon’s lips
tighten and retract so that the teeth showed, a faint
crackling as of dry brushwood being piled against the
door of Barnabo’s house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Gascon saw the shutter open. A white face peered
in with eyes that moved like the eyes of a wonder-working
image. Then the face disappeared, and the shutter
closed again, but Gaillard was on his feet, and going to
and fro, silently rousing his men. Hardly a word was
spoken. The men caught up their arms, and stood like
listening dogs, while the archers marked the windows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard was at the door trying to lift the bar, but
some weight from without had jammed it in the sockets.
He stood listening, sniffing the air, and watching grey
puffs of smoke come curling in through the crevices.
Then he shouted an order through the hall, an order
that brought his men crowding forward for a sally.
Some of the strongest of them put their shoulders to
the bar. It flew up, letting the door swing in with a
gush of smoke and a crash of falling faggots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out—out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard and his men broke through, hurling the
brushwood aside, dragging it into the hall, cursing as
they realised the devil’s trick that had been played them.
Only the outer faggots were alight. There was a gush
of flame under the hooded entry, but Gaillard and his
men sprang through it with a weird glitter of gold upon
their harness, and an uprush of smoke and sparks. Dark
figures flitted about the priest’s garden. Arrows whistled
and struck the walls as the Savoyard’s men came tumbling
out over the burning faggots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sharp tussle in the garden; blows were
given and taken in the dark; arrows shot at a venture;
torches thrust into hairy faces. Gaillard’s men-at-arms
in their heavy mail, for they had lain down armed to
sleep, were more than a match for the woodlanders in
their leather jerkins. Soon—scampering shadows went
away into the moonlight. Gaillard and his men were
left to put out the fire about the porch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And savage men they were, men with the hot flare
of that death trap in their nostrils. The two sentinels
had been stalked and killed, and the brushwood piled
against the door. The windows were so narrow that
men could have been shot while struggling through
them. The flames and smoke would have leapt in,
making the place a hell of plunging, terrified beasts, and
mad and half-dazed men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard watched his fellows trampling on the brushwood.
Now and again an arrow came whistling out of
the moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will pay them for this,” he said grimly. “God,
but they meant to burn us like blind mice in a stack!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fire was soon out, and there was nothing left
but to wait for the daylight, and to keep the house in
darkness so that no lurking woodlander should have
the outline of a window for a mark. Gaillard’s men
were very sullen and bitter over the night’s adventure.
They had brought in the two dead sentinels, and crowded
about them, letting their fury break out in growls for
to-morrow’s reckoning. There was no more sleep for
Gaillard’s men that night; they squatted round the
walls, telling each other what they would do to these
people who murdered priests and set fire to houses where
the King’s men slept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dawn came with a thick mist hanging over the
woods, even covering the crowns of the uplands of Bright
Ling. Gaillard had made his plans, and in the garden
the little spy was drawing a map on the soil with the
point of a charred stake. The archers had gone out to
scout, but had found nothing but fog and rotting bracken.
Gaillard ordered his men to horse, and they were soon
on the move through the mist, the drippings from the
trees falling on them, and on grass that was grey with
dew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hunchback, marching beside Gaillard’s horse,
led them towards Goldspur, following the high ground
where there was less chance of an ambuscade. Gaillard
had ordered silence. Not a man spoke. The grey shapes
moved through the greyer mist with no sounds but the
dull shuffle of hoofs, the occasional snort of a horse,
the creaking of saddles, and the faint jingle of steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was still very early when they came to the hill
above Goldspur, and skirted the great beech wood whose
topmost boughs were beginning to glitter in the sunlight.
The mist lifted quite suddenly like a white diaphanous
curtain drawn up into the sky. A broad beam of sunlight
clove like a sword into the deeps of the beech wood.
And to these rough riders of Peter of Savoy was revealed
a vision, a vision such as a crystal-gazer might watch
growing from nothingness in the heart of a crystal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the full sunlight at the opening of a glade a woman
stood washing herself at a forest pool. The woman’s
figure gleamed like snow against the sombre trunks of
the trees. Her hair blazed about her naked body like
flames licking a white tower. As yet she had not seen
that line of armed men winding along the hillside not a
hundred paces from where she stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard reined in, and held up a hand for his men to
halt. He looked from the woman to the hunchback
who held his stirrup strap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, what have we here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cripple crossed himself, cur that he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Denise of the Forest, lording,” he said. “They
call her their Lady of Healing in these parts. She has
a cell yonder, in the wood. She can work miracles, so
they say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rough faces behind Gaillard were all agog. A
short, yapping laugh came from some man in the rear.
Gaillard turned in the saddle, and looked for the man
who had made the noise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough of that, sirs,” he said. “Shall we laugh
because a saint happens not to cherish vermin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps curiosity pricked Gaillard, perhaps something
still more human. At all events he pushed his horse
forward and rode alone up the stretch of green turf
that sloped towards the beech wood. The men grinned
like apes so soon as his back was turned. Messire Gaillard
might be a great captain, but assuredly he was no saint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard was laughing to himself with a coarse spirit
of mischief, being inquisitive as to what this woman
would do when she discovered that she was no longer
alone. He carried his chin high in the air, his hard eyes
gleaming like the eyes of a man who has drunk strong
wine. But Denise made her womanhood a thing of pride
and splendour that spring morning. Her tunic was still
open at the bosom when the Gascon’s horse threw a
shadow on the grass close to the pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise looked Gaillard straight in the eyes, and yet
not at him, but past him, as though he were so much
vapour. Gaillard, Gascon that he was, had not a word
to say for himself, though he boasted himself so debonair
with women. Denise took her hair with her hands, put
it behind her shoulders, and picking up the clean cloth
that she had brought, turned and walked away into the
wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For once in his life Gaillard felt a fool, and his arrant
sheepishness did not please him. He comforted himself
with that infallible sneer that is the refuge of a vain
man who has done something mean and cowardly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Red-headed Pharisee, go your way,” he said. “A
woman’s sanctity is as thick as her skin. Fool! I am
not the first sheep that has bleated in these parts.”</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER V</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald the priest stood on guard under the ash tree
where the road left Goldspur for the open fields. He
had a buckler on his arm, and an axe over his shoulder.
His short, frayed cassock showed the beginnings of a
brown and mighty pair of calves, and the feet in the
leather sandals looked like the feet of an Atlas whose
shoulders wedged up the heavens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There had been a panic at Goldspur that morning,
when a lad had run in with the news that he had seen
armed men riding through the mist, and that they were
marching towards Goldspur. And Grimbald, stalking
down into the village, had met some of the younger
men skulking off as though there were no women and
children to be remembered. Grimbald had twisted a
stake out of the hedge, dusted some decent shame into
these cowards, and driven them back into Goldspur
much as a drover drives his cattle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald had found the village in an uproar, for
Aymery was away with Waleran, and the folk had
tumbled over each other for the lack of a leader. Men
and boys had herded in sheep and cattle, and the beasts
were bolting all ways, and taking every road but the
right one. Women, weeping, scolding, chattering, were
carrying out their chattels from the cottages. One
had a baby at the breast; another clutched a young
pig; a third sat at her door, and screamed like a silly
girl. Men were arguing, shouting, quarrelling, eager
to do the same thing, but obstinate in trying to do it
each in his several way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Grimbald had come and shepherded the people,
knocked together the heads of the men who quarrelled,
and turned disorder into order. The sheep, cattle, and
pigs were driven off towards the woods. Men, women,
and children followed, carrying all that they could put
upon their backs. In a quarter of an hour from Grimbald’s
coming Goldspur village was a row of empty
hovels, with nothing alive there but a few chickens, and
the sparrows, who trusted in God, and continued to
build in the thatch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald had set himself at the lower end of the
village, and stood there like the giant figure of some
protecting saint. He was about to follow his flock
when he saw a man on horseback round a spur of woodland
in the valley. He came on at a canter for the
village, and Grimbald knew him for Aymery by the
colours of his surcoat and his horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery reined in, hot with galloping, his eyes keen
and full of flashes of light. He had been with Waleran,
and had ridden to warn his people of what they might
expect that day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald pointed with his axe to the open doors of
the hovels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are safe in the woods by now. Have you
had view of Peter’s gentry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery turned his horse, and shaded his eyes with
his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They left the priest’s house under Bright Ling—at
dawn. Waleran tried a trick there, but the dogs
smelt the smoke. I saw their spears coming down the
hill as I crossed the valley.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery looked towards the beech wood on the hill,
his eyes flashing back the morning sunlight. The muscles
of his jaw were hard and tense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must bide our time, and watch them,” he said;
“they are coming to make a bonfire here. They can
burn every stick of the place so long as they have not
meddled with Denise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald shifted his axe from one shoulder to the
other. If ever a man had cause to be jealous of a woman,
that man was Grimbald. But his heart was too warm
and too well tilled to harbour such a weed. He thanked
God for the good he found in the world, and did not
quarrel with it because it was not part of his own halo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She cannot be left yonder,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery still looked at the beech wood, head thrown
back, grey eyes a-glitter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must take cover and watch. They will be
here soon, and we shall see. To-night, I will take her
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gleam of spears showed in the valley, and Aymery
rode off to the nearest wood with Grimbald holding to
his stirrups. They saw Gaillard and his men come
over the fields to Goldspur village, and Denise was not
with them. Aymery’s eyes made sure of that. The
Gascon found nothing but the empty hovels, the untroubled
sparrows, and a black cock crowing and scratching
on a dunghill. One of Gaillard’s men fitted an arrow
to the string, shot the black cock through the body, and
laughed at the way the bird tumbled and flapped in the
death agony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother Barnabo may find use for him,” said someone,
and there was a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He will wake him before daylight,” quoth another.
“Such birds are useful to gallant clerks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goldspur village did not go up in smoke that morning,
for Gaillard, cunning as a fox, did not always run straight
for the game in view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will take our dinner elsewhere, sirs,” he said.
“When we are over the hill, the fools may think that
they will see us no more. When does a cat catch mice?
We shall do better in the dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Aymery and Grimbald saw him and his men ride
on towards the west as though an empty village were too
miserable a thing even to be burnt. Nor did they turn
aside to where the gable end of the manor house showed
amid the oak trees. It seemed that Gaillard had another
quest in view. Goldspur was left to the sparrows and
the dead cock on the dunghill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery and Grimbald watched the raiders till they
had disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are free of them for one day, brother. What
about our people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We had better look to the fools,” said Grimbald.
“They are as frightened as rabbits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they went off together into the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery and the priest found the Goldspur folk
penning their cattle in a wild part of the forest. The
men had cut boughs and furze bushes, and the women
were building rude huts for shelter at night. Aymery
sent some of the boys to scout through the forest, and
bring back any news of Gaillard that they could gather.
About noon one of Waleran’s men came in, with a word
to Aymery that Waleran and the woodlanders were
gathering to ambush the Savoyard’s men. Grimbald
and Aymery went off to join in the tussle, but saw nothing
of Waleran though they sought him most of the day.
A woodman who was felling oak trees to bark for the
tanner, told them that young St. Leger had ridden by,
and that Gaillard and his company had marched back
beyond Bright Ling. Aymery and the priest turned
homewards towards Goldspur. The long shadows of
evening were purple upon the grass, and Aymery’s
heart remembered Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came to Goldspur manor as the dusk was
falling, and the song of the birds went up towards the
sunset, and everything was very still. The bridge
was down over the narrow moat, and the gate open;
no man had been there all that day, for Aymery’s servants
had fled with the village folk, and two men who could
handle their bows had been sent two days ago with
Waleran into the woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald drew the bridge, while Aymery went to
the stable to feed and water his horse. They had no
fear of Peter of Savoy’s riders that night, and took their
augury from the fact that Gaillard had left the place
untouched that morning. Grimbald carried tinder and
steel in his wallet, and he lit a torch in the hall, and
went to the pantry and kitchen to get bread, beer, and
meat for supper. He and Aymery sat down in the empty
hall, and ate for a while in silence, like men who were
weary, or were sunk in thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were nearly through with their hunger, and
were talking of Denise and the hermitage, when Grimbald,
who was about to finish his mead, paused with the
horn between the table and his mouth. The men’s
eyes met across the board. They were both listening,
motionless as images carved in stone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night seemed dark and silent without, the woodlands
asleep, the night empty of all unrest. Yet there
had come to Grimbald a sense of something moving in
the darkness. And as they listened there was a faint
splash from the moat, and a sound like the creaking of
wet leather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald’s eyes were fixed on Aymery’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A rat in the moat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald put his horn down on the table, rose up
swiftly and silently, and taking his axe, went out into
the courtyard. Aymery’s sword and shield hung from
a peg in the wall. He took them down, and had gained
the door of the hall when he heard a sudden scuffling
of feet, an oath in the darkness, the harsh breathing
of men at grips, the splash of something into the water
of the moat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A scattering of arrows whirred and pecked at the
walls, one slanting in and smiting the flagstones close
to Aymery’s feet. He heard the dull jingle of armed
men on the move. Grimbald towered back suddenly
out of the night, a red splash of blood on his forehead,
his eyes shining in the torchlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flung the door to, and ran the oak bar through
the staples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother, we are trapped! I took the first of them
and pitched him into the moat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his shaggy head, and looked round the
hall. Aymery was buckling on his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is the garden bridge,” he said. “We can
make a dash for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Away, then; they are wading the moat, and climbing
the palisade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery pushed in front of Grimbald as they hurried
down a narrow passage-way that led from the hall and
the kitchen quarters into the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I go first, brother,” he said. “I have my steel
coat; a stab in the dark might find your heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald passed a huge arm about Aymery as they
went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lad, what is that to me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came out into the garden, and stood for a
moment listening. They could hear Gaillard’s men
beating in the door of the hall, but towards the garden
everything seemed quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery laid a hand on Grimbald’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If one of us is taken, brother, let not the other
tarry. Remember Denise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald understood him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” he said in an undertone, and they crossed
the garden side by side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now there was a trestle-bridge from the garden over
the moat, a footbridge made of a single plank that could
be thrust across and withdrawn at pleasure. A wicket
in the palisade led to the bridge. Aymery unbarred
the gate, and ran the plank forward on to the
trestles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall trick them,” he said grimly, “quick, they
have broken in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ran across the bridge, Grimbald following, the
plank creaking and sagging under the priest’s weight.
Aymery had stooped to drag the plank away again,
when he heard Grimbald give a short, deep cry, and
saw him spring forward and smite at something with
his axe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guard, brother, guard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Steel crashed upon steel, a glitter of sparks flying
from axe and helmet. An arrow stopped quivering
in Aymery’s shield as he sprang forward to Grimbald’s
aid. Men rose at him out of the darkness. Dimly
in the midst of the waving swords, he had a glimpse
of two men clinging to Grimbald. He saw the priest
shake them off, and beat them down before him as a
boy snaps thistles with a stick. There was a rush of
armed men in the darkness, the dash of steel against
steel as they blundered one against another. The red
splutter of a torch came tossing out of the night, with
the hoarse shouting of men trying to tell friend from
foe. Grimbald and Aymery lost each other, and fought
each for his own hand.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Through the darkness of the night went Denise, her
grey cloak passing amid the beech trees like some dim
ghost shape that drifts with the night breeze. She had
been restless and distraught all day, her splendour of
peace ruffled, her heart filling with a distrust of the
near future. To begin with, out of the grey fog of the
morning had come the man on the black horse, the man
with the red eyes and the insolent scoffing mouth.
Gaillard had made her shudder despite her pride, for she
had learnt to hate the look of such a man before the
woods had hidden her from the world. Feeling a shadow
of evil near her, Denise had gone down to Goldspur
after the Gascon and his men had ridden on, and had found
the place deserted, so many silent hovels in a silent
landscape. She had wandered up to the manor house,
and found the same silence there, the same foreshadowings
of tragedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of the day had dragged slowly for her in
the great beech wood, and she had found her thoughts
wandering like children into a forbidden place. And
Denise’s pride would start up after these same thoughts,
seize on them in that little pleasaunce of dreams, drag
them forth, and bar the door. But there was a restless
refrain in the mood of the day. The future seemed to
fly open before her eyes like the magic gate of an enchanted
garden, and she had a glimpse of paradise bathed in a
mist of gold. Her thoughts were lured thither, though
her pride arose and drove them back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the dusk the spirit of unrest in her had deepened,
and she had seemed to hear voices calling through the
twilight of the woods. A thrush had perched on the
topmost bough of a beech tree, and had uttered his
desire, till the plaint had rung and rung into Denise’s
heart. She had tossed her cloak at the bird, but none
of the wild things feared her. And though the dusk
fell, the song of the thrush seemed to thrill through the
brown gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then night had come, and her cell had seemed small
and stifling, a vault for a live soul. She had thrown
her grey cloak over her shoulders, and gone out into the
beech wood, following the path that led towards Goldspur
manor. Her brown eyes had more than human vision
in the darkness, and she knew the wood ways even at
night. It was as though she went out to watch over
the place, and to dispel the shadow of dread that had
settled over her own heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had come to the end of the wood where the
grassland swept down into the valley, when she stopped
to listen, putting her hood back so that she might hear
more clearly. Her face was towards Goldspur, and she
merged her body into shadow of the trunk of a great
tree. Abruptly out of the night came the sudden sound
of men shouting, a vague clamour that rose and fell like
the noise of a wind through trees. Dots of light shone
out in the darkness, jerking to and fro like sparks blown
hither and thither by the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise stood there watching these dots of fire, afraid
yet not afraid, striving to understand what was happening
down there in the darkness. The shouting died down
suddenly, to change into the scattered cries of men
running to and fro. The torches tossed this way and
that as though Gaillard’s fellows were hunting for fugitives,
calling to one another as they doubled upon their tracks.
One of the torches came some little distance up the hill
towards the beech wood and then halted, and remained
motionless, flaming like the eye of a cyclops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had drawn back behind the tree, when she
heard the sound of something moving in the darkness.
A black shape passed momentarily between her and
the torch burning below upon the hillside. Footsteps
came near to her, the stumbling, irregular, running steps
of a man hard put for breath, and perhaps—for blood.
He passed close to her in the darkness, labouring for
breath, and staggering from side to side. She could still
see the moving shadow in the gloom, when it plunged
like a man falling forward over a cliff, and she heard the
sound of a body striking the crisp, dead leaves. Fear
was beneath Denise’s feet for the moment. The man
had fallen over the straggling root of a tree, and he
was struggling to rise as Denise came up with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had gained his feet, and stood rocking like a
drunken man, trying to steady himself, and to win
forward into the wood. But his legs would not carry
him, and he went swaying as though struck on the chest,
to stagger against Denise before she could avoid him.
She felt the hard rings of his hauberk against her bosom,
and to save herself she held the man, throwing an arm
about his body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Caught thus from behind, he turned his head and
looked at her, not questioning the strangeness of it,
being dazed and almost dead with what had passed.
His face was so close to hers that Denise could not but
know him, even in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aymery!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice set his dull brain thrilling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kept her arm about him, for there was nothing
else for her to do, and he would have fallen had she not
held him. Aymery’s face was as white as linen, and
she could feel him quivering as he stood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peter of Savoy’s men, we were caught yonder,
Grimbald and I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke in jerks, and tried to stand apart from her,
as though one purpose had carried him so far, and as
though the same purpose dominated him still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want breath, that is all; they pressed us hard,
there, at Goldspur; we broke through, and I ran for
the hills. You must go, Denise, to-night; make for
one of the coast towns. I can look to myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was at the end of his strength, however, for all
his hardihood, with a sword cut through the shoulder,
an arrow broken in his thigh. Denise could see nothing
of all this, but she knew that he could hardly stand.
Moreover, he had struggled up into the wood to warn
her, and her heart was the heart of a woman though the
people called her a saint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking back over her shoulder she saw tongues of
yellow flame rising from Goldspur in the valley. Gaillard’s
men had set fire to the place. The glow from it caught
Aymery’s eyes as he stood, swaying at the knees, great
sickness upon him, even his wrath feeble in him because
of his wounds and his weariness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have lit me a torch to travel by,” he said
bitterly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was shading her eyes with her hand. She
turned swiftly upon Aymery, for she had seen mounted
men moving on the hillside between her, and the burning
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord,” she said simply, “yesterday, you were
afraid for my sake; to-night, it is I who fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes met his, and held them. The secret thoughts
of the day no longer had their half treacherous significance.
Denise had no thought of self in her that moment; the
succouring hands hid the dull radiance of the heart
beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-night you must rest and sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her, as though trying to understand.
The darkness began to deepen about him, and he felt
cold, and numb to the core.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can crawl to cover. If you could bring me wine
and food, and a little linen——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went close to him suddenly, and passed her hands
over his hauberk. Touch told her the whole truth.
She had no false shame to make her weak and careful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wounds, and you would have hidden them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little blood, nothing more. Let me lie here,
Denise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To die,” and her voice had a deep, quiet passion
in it; “lord, would you choose death for a piece of
pride! Come, I know the ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put an arm about him, as though she was stronger
than Aymery that night, and had the will and courage to
do for him what he, in his full strength, would have
done for her. Suffering and sickness sweep the small
prides of life aside. The heart of a woman is as elemental,
then, as the wind or the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lean on me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her half rebelliously, and then hung
his head, and obeyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How great his need was became apparent before
they had reached the clearing amid the beech trees.
The man stumbled and faltered at every step, his head
fell forward, he muttered incoherently, like one in the
heat of a fever. Denise felt his weight bearing more
heavily upon her arm. His head drooped, and rested
upon her shoulder. Before they reached the wattle
gate of the garden the conscious life was out of him,
and Denise, borne down like a vine-ladened sapling bent
by the wind, let the man slip from her gently to the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stood irresolute a moment, then stooping and
putting her two hands under his shoulders, she found
that she could drag him slowly up the stone path into
her cell. Once within she closed the door, and slipping
off her cloak, she covered the slit of a window with it.
There was a little earthen lamp in the cell, and Denise
sought and found it in the darkness, also tinder, flint,
and steel. Yet her hands shook so with her labour of
bearing up under Aymery’s weight, that it was a minute
or more before she had the lamp burning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Setting it upon a stone sconce in the wall, she bent
over Aymery, the light of the lamp making his face seem
white as the face of the dead. Her brown eyes grew
frightened at the sight of his wounds, and at the way
he lay so quiet, and so still. But there was something
greater than fear in Denise’s heart that night. In a
corner of the cell were some rough boards covered with
dry bracken, a coarse white sheet, and a coverlet of wool.
Denise, putting her arms once more under the man’s
body, half dragged and half lifted him to her own rough
bed.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The night was far spent, and the oil in the earthen lamp
had failed some hours ago. Denise, sitting in the darkness,
with her chin resting on her hands, listened to Aymery’s
breathing, and waited for the dawn. Nerving herself,
she had twisted the arrow’s head from the flesh, unlaced
his hauberk and bound up the wounded shoulder, and
poured some wine between his lips. For a long time
she had watched him for signs of returning consciousness.
Then the lamp had died out and left them in the darkness,
and Denise had sat wondering whether the man’s quietude
meant sleep or death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise did not close her eyes that night. She was
wakeful, strangely wakeful, almost conscious of the beating
of her heart. More than once she had bent forward
and touched Aymery’s hand, and its coldness chilled her,
so that she longed for the day. Often too in the
strained suspense of the night’s silence she would
fancy that he had ceased to breathe, and she would
fall a-praying with a passion that startled even her
own heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint greyness beneath the door, a sudden tentative
cry from some awakened bird. For a while silence,
then sudden and strange, a thrilling up of note on note,
a sense as of golden light mounting in sweeping spirals
towards the sky. Wizard’s magic in the grey of the
great wood, a thousand throats throbbing in unison
till the whole world seemed full of a glory of sound.
The very air quivered within the cell. It was as though
invisible wings were beating everywhere, while the trees
of the forest were tongued with prophetic fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise rose, opened wide the door, and let the song
of the birds come to her with the cold fragrance of the
breaking day. As yet greyness everywhere, grey grass,
grey trees. A gradual gathering of light, then, of a
sudden, as though some god had hurled fire into the sky,
a blur of gold, a cry of crimson from the mouths of the
pale clouds. Soon, an arch of amber in the east, the
forest black against the splendour thereof, the grass
a-gleam, the sky in the zenith still dim like a woman’s
eyes dim with tears. A beautiful tenderness transfigured
the face of the world; no wicked thing seemed thinkable
while those birds were singing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the dawn came, and flung his torch into the cell
at Denise’s feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that the daylight absolved her from suspense,
she turned, a little fearfully, and knelt down beside the
bed. The man’s face was in the shadow, so that it looked
very sharp and grey to her, yet he was breathing quietly
with his lips closed. Only a little blood had soaked
through the bandages. Yet Denise knelt watching him,
unable to shake off the haunting dread that he might
not wake to see another dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether it was the daylight playing on his face, or
the long gaze of Denise’s eyes, Aymery awoke without
so much as the stirring of a hand, and looked up straight
into the woman’s face. And for some moments those
two stared silently into each other’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery half rose upon his elbow, but Denise’s hand
went to his unwounded shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lie still,” she said to him, with a pressure of the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He obeyed her, and sank back upon the bed. Denise
saw his lips move, but no words came from them. His
eyes wandered from her face about the cell, as though
the slow consciousness of it all were flowing into his
brain. And as the daylight broadened, his mind’s awakening
seemed to keep pace with it. He was lying in
Denise’s cell, and upon Denise’s bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long have I been here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bent towards him, her hair shining about her
face. Aymery’s eyes caught the sheen thereof, and
seemed dazzled by its glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only lie still,” she said. “In the night I thought
that you would die. You are safe here. None but
friends know the ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seemed to feel the first burning of his wounds,
for his hand went to his right shoulder, but Denise
caught it, and laid it upon the coverlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have looked to your wounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did I come here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes searched her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are safe, is not that enough; yet, you were
very heavy,” and she smiled at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen Grimbald?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery was silent for a moment, looking at Denise
with a kind of quiet wonder. Her face was turned
from him. And suddenly he caught her hand, and
lifted it, and for a moment its whiteness lay across
Aymery’s mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God guard you, Denise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes flashed down at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must live. I ask that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly, I cannot die.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise rose up and went out into the sunlight, for
her face had blazed suddenly with blood that rushed
from the heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first thing that Denise did that morning was
to take a pitcher that stood beside the door, and to go
down to the spring to draw water. There were drops
of the man’s blood upon the stones of the path, and
Denise, bringing back her pitcher, washed the stains
away so that they should offer no betrayal. The beech
wood seemed still and empty in the morning sunlight.
Yet the peril of the night haunted her heart continually
with an innocence that had no thought of self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went to refill the pitcher at the spring, looking
watchfully down every dwindling woodway, and listening
even for the rustle of dead leaves. Aymery was lying
awake when she returned. His eyes watched her a
little restlessly, and there was something in those eyes
of his that made the blood come more quickly to her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning to a cupboard she took out bread, honey,
and a little jar of wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that water, there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was looking at the pitcher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise understood him instantly, for she found a
clean napkin in the cupboard, moistened it, and bent
over the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your lips are dry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put a hand under his head, raised it, and washed
his mouth and face. He held out his hands to her, and
she washed those also, yet her eyes avoided Aymery’s,
and their deeps were hidden from him by the shadows of
their lashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you hungry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not even a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you must eat for your strength’s sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will do all that you desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She would not suffer him to manage for himself,
but spread the honey on the bread, and held the wine
flask for him to drink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is all that I can give,” she said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her, but found no answer for the moment.
Both of them had grown suddenly shy of one another
and when their hands touched, the touch thrilled them
from hand to heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise left him at last, and going to the doorway
of the cell, stood to break bread for her own need. Yet
though her face was turned from him, she could not put
the man’s nearness from her, and the bread as she crumbled
it, fell in waste on the stones at her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s voice startled her. He had not spoken
loudly, but there was a return of strength in the tone
thereof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall be rid of me before nightfall. I only
ask for a day’s grace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had turned and was looking down at him with
solemn eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be days before you must stir,” she said.
“Remember that I saw your wounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, I know otherwise. You will bide there on
that bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke quietly enough, but Aymery looked up at her
restlessly, watching the sunlight shining through her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot lie here, Denise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are safe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too safe, perhaps; it is not of my own safety——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He paused, but not before she had caught his meaning.
The truth was difficult for Aymery to utter, and yet she
honoured him for thinking of her honour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None but our friends come this way,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He half rose in bed with the strong and generous
passion that made his pale face shine on her out of the
darkness of the cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother of God, child, am I so selfish, and so blind!
Do I not remember what you are, to all of us in these
parts. If these dogs found me here! I would rather
crawl on my hands and knees than tempt that chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face flushed deeply, but not because of the mere
words that he had spoken. A sudden impulse seized
her, an impulse that came she knew not whither. Aymery
had sunk back again, and the sight of this strong man’s
weakness went to her heart. In the taking of a breath
she was bending over him, and holding the wooden cross
that hung at her girdle. Kissing it she held it before
Aymery’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, let this be as a sign between us, for I have no
fear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at the cross, then at Denise, and his eyes
seemed to catch the glimmer of her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise, but one day,” he said. “To-morrow——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave God the morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet, who knows what even the morrow may bring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise turned from him, and going out, closed the
door. She stood leaning against it, looking above the
trees into the blue of a spring sky. Infinitely strange,
infinitely wonderful seemed this mysterious fire that
had been kindled suddenly within her heart. Quench
it she could not, though she strove to smother and hide
it even from herself. As for Aymery, the cell seemed
very dark to him, for lack of the radiance that had
streamed from her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise went down through the beech wood towards
Goldspur that morning, meaning to see whether Gaillard
and his men had gone. The valley was full of sunlight,
but over the village hung a thin dun-coloured mist,
with pale smoke curling upwards into the blue. No
live thing moved in the valley, and even her hope of
the glimpse of a friend failed her. Still, her heart was
glad that there were no riders there, and that the violence
of the night seemed farther from her world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard had gone. He and his men had passed the
night, drinking and warming themselves before the burning
house, none too pleased with the evening’s handiwork.
Soon after dawn a rider had come galloping in, beaconed
through the darkness by the glare of the burning manor,
and Gaillard, when he had spoken with the fellow, had
ordered his men to horse, after they had buried two
comrades who had fallen beneath Grimbald’s axe. They
had ridden away towards the sea, since my Lord of Savoy
had called Gaillard back to Pevensey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night before, some thirty “spears” and a company
of archers had marched in from Lewes, sent thence
by John de Warenne, the Earl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since the iron is hot in your parts, sire,” ran the
Earl’s message, “I send you a hammer for your anvil.
God keep the King.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter of Savoy had laughed at the message, and
thrown a jewel into Etoile’s lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The book tells us that we should go a-hunting,”
he had said. “We will send for the Gascon back again.
There are lusty rebels to be pulled down when the King’s
need is paramount.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etoile had laughed in turn, with a gleam of black
eyes and of white teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let our horns blow, sire, I too will ride with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bolt in time saves twine,” quoth her man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Gaillard returned that morning, and Peter
of Savoy heard the news of Dan Barnabo’s death, and
the way the mesne lords had called out their men, he
smiled at Gaillard very grimly, and twitted him with
the little that he had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are clever at lighting bonfires, my Gascon,”
he said. “But singeing the bear makes him only madder.
We have no need of our clerks and lawyers, for when
such work is afoot we can shut justiciar, coroner, and
sheriff up in the same box. Will any man tell me that
I have no right of private war in my own manors. The
King is defied! Go to now, we have our warrant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard showed his teeth, and shot a stealthy,
swaggering look towards Etoile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To catch the fox, sire, we must have hounds enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take them, my boaster, and sweep the countryside.
We will ride with you to see the chase.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And madame, also? We will show her how these
pigs of Englishmen can run.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That same evening as the sun sank low, Denise went
down to draw water at the spring. The woods were
full of a glory of gold, and the chequered shadows of the
trees fell upon the brown leaves, and the vivid grass.
The gorse seemed lit as for the evening of All Souls.
Perfumes rose out of the pregnant earth. A hundred
thrushes seemed chanting a vesper song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heart of Denise also was full of strange, elfin
music. There was a smile upon her mouth, and her
eyes caught the enchanted distance of dreams. As she
drew water at the spring and the ripples of the pool
were inset with gold, she sang to herself softly, a song
that she had learnt as a young girl, a song of the tower,
and not of the cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery heard her singing as she came across the
glade to the gate of the garden. The door of the cell
stood open, but Denise had hung her cloak so as to
hide the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she came in to him, Aymery watched her with
the eyes of a man whose heart is troubled. For he
felt the guilt of his presence in that place, and the fairness
of Denise had made him afraid. True, she had taken
no formal vows, but to the world she was a creature
whose very feet made the brown earth holy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No news of Grimbald?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her deep voice thrilled him, but he stirred uneasily
upon the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have gained strength to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not waste it, then, lord,” she answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes pleaded with her like the eyes of a dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me a hand, Denise; I will try if I can
stand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; why, you will but open your wounds again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My thoughts are more to me than my wounds,
Denise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He struggled up suddenly before she could hinder
him, only to turn faint and dizzy, for the blood fell from
his brain. He swayed, and went grey as Denise’s gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you mad, lord; you will die of your wilfulness!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her arm about his shoulders, and her hair
brushed against his cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise, if I could so much as crawl——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His wistfulness woke a rush of tenderness in her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, rest here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rest! I cannot rest, cannot you understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s arm was still about his shoulders. They
looked into each other’s eyes, one long look full of mystery,
of sadness, and unrest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My heart understands you,” she said very softly.
“Yet, is there shame in my wishing you to live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let him lie back on the bed, and taking the wine,
she made him drink, and her hand brushed the hair from
off his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must sleep,” she said. “No harm can come
while I am watching.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Aymery’s eyes were full of a silent awe.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sound of horns in the woodlands as the
morning of the second day drew towards noon, and Denise,
who had gone down towards Goldspur to discover whether
Grimbald or any of the villagers had returned, heard
the distant winding of the horns, and stood still to
listen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day was sunny, with a light breeze blowing, and
Denise could see no live thing stirring in the whole valley
where the ashes of Goldspur still threw out silver smoke.
Yet those distant horns beyond the hills seemed to
carry a cry of strangeness and unrest. Denise would
have given much to know all that was passing yonder,
but no man came that way and she dared not leave the
beech wood, and the wounded man in the cell. The very
silence and emptiness of the landscape filled her with
vague dread. No one had dared to return to the fields
or the burnt village. The hawk was still hovering,
and the small birds kept their cover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery was asleep when Denise returned to the
cell, but he woke at her coming, and looked up at her
for news.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have seen nothing but the smoke from Goldspur,”
she said calmly enough. “Grimbald and the people
still keep to the woods. They may be with us any
hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery lay quiet for a while as though sunk in
thought. His consciousness reflected clearly the meaning
of the past and the promise of the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So they have burnt Goldspur,” he said, as though
speaking the words of a prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had set the door wide, and drawn a stool into
the sunlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely there is some law left in the land?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have surfeited ourselves with law,” he said
bitterly; “only to learn that the law bows itself to
the man with the sword and the title.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise leant back against the rough oak door-post.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will build the house again?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not answer her for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not yet,” he said at last. “The sword is the
first tool that we Englishmen must handle. These Frenchmen
laugh at us, calling us English swine, but the day
is near when the tusks of the English boar shall be red
with their blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke with the fierceness of the man of the sword,
but Denise’s heart was with him, though her hands
were held to be hands of mercy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such men as Hubert of Kent, they are our need,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hubert! The land shall give us a hundred Huberts,”
and his face blazed up at her. “It will be the bills of
England against the spears of this hired scum from France
and Flanders, these dogs in the service of dogs who have
plundered our lands and shamed our women. They
have laughed at us, robbed us, made a puppet of our
king. ‘Get you to England,’ has been the cry, ‘It is a
land of fools, of heavy men stupid with mead and swine’s
flesh. Take what you will. The savages will only gape
and grumble.’ But I tell you, Denise, the heart of
England has grown hot with a slow, sure wrath. We
are Normans no longer, nor Saxons, nor Danes. Men
are gripping hands from sea to sea. God see to it, but
the years will prove that England is England, the land
of the English, and woe to those who shall trifle with
our strength.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like a mocking voice came the cry of a horn, echoing
tauntingly amid the hills. Another took up the blast,
and yet another, cheerily braying through the young
green of the woods. The two in the cell were mute for
the moment, looking questioningly into each other’s
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery raised himself upon his elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Savoyard’s men!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s eyes were full of a startled brightness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not Waleran?” she asked him as she stood
listening at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the sound of our Sussex horns.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stepped out into the sunlight, and went swiftly
down the path towards the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lie still,” she called to him. “I will go and see
what may be learnt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise knew every alley in the wood, and her grey
gown glided westwards amid the dark boles of the trees.
Ever and again the horns sang lustily to one another,
coming nearer and ever nearer, swelled by the faint but
ominous tonguing of dogs. Denise went forward more
slowly, pausing often to listen, her brown eyes growing
more watchful as the sounds came nearer to her through
the maze of the woods. She could feel even her own
heart beating; and her face sharpened with the keenness
of her vigilance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise drew back abruptly behind the trunk of a
great tree. She had heard a crackling of dry leaves, a
sound of men moving, voices calling in harsh undertones,
one to the other. She crouched down amid the gnarled
tree roots, her lips apart, her eyes at gaze. The heavy
breathing of tired beasts came to her, with the rustle
of leaves, and the quick plodding of many feet. As she
crouched there she saw figures go scurrying away through
the mysterious shadowland of the woods. Some were
mounted on forest ponies, others fleeing on foot. One
man passed within ten yards of Denise, his mouth open,
his hands clawing the air beside him as he ran. None
of them saw her, none of them looked back. They disappeared
like so many flitting shadows, and a second
silence covered their tracks as water closes behind the
keel of a ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise tarried no longer, but rose and ran back
towards the cell. Those flying shadows amid the beech
trees had told her all that she could need to know. As
for Aymery, she must hide him and take her chance.
Her gown gleamed in and out through shadow and sunshine,
while the tonguing of the dogs and the scream
of the horns haunted her like the discords of a
dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had half crossed the clearing when she saw
a sight that made her catch her breath. Close by the
gate lay Aymery, propping himself upon one arm, his
head drooping like the head of a man who has been
smitten through with a sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ran to him, her eyes a-fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, what have you done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lifted his face to her, a face that was grey and
moist in the sunlight. She saw that the linen swathings
over his shoulder were red with vivid stains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have time—yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise bent over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are mad, you are bleeding anew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me wine, Denise; I can crawl, if I cannot
walk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She put her arms about him and tried to lift him to
his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, come back to the cell. They are beating
the woods. I saw men flying for their lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery clung to her, and gained his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise, I must take my chance, help me into the
woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But his eyes went dim and blind in the sunlight,
and Denise, as she looked at him, uttered a sharp,
passionate cry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, you have tempted death enough. Come.
There is no time to lose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was strong beyond her strength as she put
an arm about him, and half led, half carried him into
the cell. She let Aymery sink upon the bed, and covered
him with the coverlet that he had thrown aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For God’s love, lie still,” she said. “Should
they come this way I will put them off with lies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise went out from him and closed the door. For
a moment a great faintness seized her, for she had taxed
her very soul in carrying Aymery within. The sunlight
flashed and flickered before her eyes, so that she put
her hands up before her face, and leant, trembling,
against the door. But the sound of the horns and the
dogs grew louder in the beech wood, and Denise’s strength
came back to her with that fine courage that women
show when life and death hang in the balance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With one quick glance at the woods she went down
on her knees on the stone-paved path, and began to
pull up the few weeds that she could find in the borders.
Her hair had become loosened in her flight through the
wood, and hung in waves about her neck and shoulders.
Denise kept her eyes on the ground before her, though
her ears were straining to catch the slightest sound.
She prayed as she knelt there, as she had never prayed
for a boon before, that these men might pass by without
seeing the dark thatch of her cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trampling of many horses swelled the shrill
whimpering and tonguing of the dogs. A horn blared
close by. The wood seemed full of voices, of swift
movement, of hurrying sounds. Denise heard the laughter
of a woman peal out suddenly, strange and unfamiliar
in the midst of such a chorus. A man’s voice shouted a
fierce command. The whole wood about the place seemed
to become alive with colour, and the gleam and clangour
of steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise bent her head over the brown soil and gave
no sign. Her fingers plucked at a tuft of grass, but could
not close on it because of their great trembling. Her
heart told her that these people would not pass by.
Swiftly, half fearfully, she raised her head, and looked
up over the wattle fence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before her the shadowy wood seemed to swim with
the faces and figures of armed men. Horses crowded
in with tossing manes, shields flickered, surcoats with
many colours. Brown-faced archers walked between
the horses, their steel caps shining, bows ready with
arrows on the strings. Rangers and servants held the
dogs in leash, sweating, panting men who cursed the
beasts that strained, and yelped, and rose upon their
haunches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the forefront of the whole rout, like a great gem
set in the centre of a crown, Denise saw a woman seated
on a milk-white horse. Her green gown was diapered
over with golden lilies, and in her hand she carried a bow.
The woman’s face was flushed with riding, and her hair
disordered in its golden caul. On her right hand rode
a lord in a surcoat of purple, and the trappings of his
horse were of white and blue. On her left, with a drawn
sword over his shoulder, Denise saw the man who had
surprised her at the spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since there was no help for it, Denise sat back upon
her heels, her face flushed with stooping over the soil.
All those hundred eyes seemed fastened upon her. Yet
there was a sudden silence save for the whimpering and
the chafing of the dogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the wattle fence, and across the narrow stretch
of grass, the eyes of the woman on the white horse met
the eyes of Denise. And some instant instinct of enmity
seemed to flash between the two, as though—being women—they
could read each other’s hearts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise saw her turn to Gaillard, and point with her
bow in the direction of the cell. The Gascon laughed,
and pretended to pray to the cross of his sword. Then
he flapped the bridle upon the neck of his horse, and rode
forward to speak with Denise.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard rode up to the wicket and saw Denise kneeling
on the path with weeds and grass tufts scattered along
the stones. Paltry, misplaced labour, this, for a woman
with such a body and such eyes and hair! Gaillard had
his grudge against Denise, and though his impulse was
to humble her, he could not forget how the morning
sunlight had struck upon her that morning at the pool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The best of matins to you, Sanctissima,” he said.
“I trust that you are rid of your sins as easily as you
are rid of those weeds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise rose to her feet, his scoffing voice bringing the
colour to her face. The look in Gaillard’s eyes made
her hate him, a jeering, masterful, boastful look that
showed that he was insolently sure of himself, and knew
how to play the bully on occasions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you, messire?” and she felt her face
hot under the man’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard stared her over, as though he had no high
opinion of women, and especially of those who were
comely and yet pretended to be righteous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy Sister,” and his eyes looked beyond her
towards the cell, “why do you shut your door so close
of a May morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His red eyes flashed down at her again, and Denise,
with a fierce burning of the cheeks, felt that he was
watching her, and that her secret might hang upon the
tremor of a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are curious over trifles,” she said curtly.
“I live alone here after my own fashion. What would
you with all your dogs and men?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard heeled his horse close to the gate. Count
Peter, Etoile, and all their company watched and
waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come nearer, Sanctissima,” said the Gascon, keeping
his eyes fixed upon her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise did not stir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come now, saint of the beech woods, put your
pride aside, and let us talk together. And keep those
eyes of yours from anger. It may be that I can give
service for service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke softly to her, almost suggestively, but
Denise hated his smoothness more than his insolence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not understand you, messire,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard’s eyes grew keen and greedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such a woman as you, my lady, should not be rash
in refusing courtesies. Now, if I ask you to open yonder
door?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tried to outstare him, but his eyes seemed to
look her innocence through and through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say what you please,” she said. “Men fled through
the wood here before you came. But I have not meddled
in your affairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tossed his head back suddenly and laughed, so
that Denise saw the red roof of his mouth above his
smooth, strong, shining chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister, do they write of such things in heaven?
Clerks tell us a tale that whenever a cock crowed, St.
Peter was seized with a spasm of coughing. Who is it
that you are hiding, yonder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise stood dumb before him. The man’s face
mocked her like the face of a mocking Faun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no answer for you, messire,” she said. “Go
back to those who sent you, and to your horns and
your dogs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned slowly, meaning to reach the cell and
bar the door, hoping the last hope that these people
would ride on and leave her in peace. But Gaillard was
too shrewd to be cheated thus. He struck his horse
with the spurs, set him at the low fence, cleared it, and
trampling the garden under foot, put himself between
Denise and the cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A capture, a capture!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed down in Denise’s face, as he waved his
sword to those who were waiting on the fringes of the
beech wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flash of the Gascon’s sword brought the whole
rout swarming down upon the place, dogs, men, and
horses, fur, steel and colour. The wattle fence went
down before them; the herbs and the spring flowers
were trampled into the soil. A horse plunged and
reared close beside Denise, so that she had a glimpse of a
black muzzle with the teeth showing, and soaring hoofs
ready to crush her to the earth. Some unknown hand
thrust her roughly aside, when a hound sprang at her,
and was dragged back snarling on the end of a leash.
Suddenly in the whirl of it she found Gaillard beside her
on his horse, pushing the beast forward so as to shelter
her from the rout that had stormed in as though half
Waleran’s rebels held the hermitage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back, fools,” and he struck at some of them with
the flat of his sword. “Out, out! Who called for a
charge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his horse this way and that, driving the
men back, and clearing a space about the cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roland, on guard there, man, by the door. Stand
to your arms, sirs; am I captain of a drove of swine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something fine in the way he wheeled his
great horse to and fro, driving men and dogs like so many
sheep. Denise, her hair falling upon her shoulders,
drew back towards the cell, her senses dazed for the
moment by all this violence and roughness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crowd of armed men parted suddenly, and through
the gap between their swords and lances came riding the
woman on the milk-white horse, haughty, yet smiling,
her bow across her knees. Peter of Savoy rode close
beside her, a quiet, noiseless man, whose cold eyes were
more dangerous than a dozen swords. Gaillard wheeled
towards them, touching his horse with the spur so that
the beast caracoled and showed off his lord’s masterfulness
in the saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter of Savoy smoothed his beard with a gloved hand
that showed a great ruby upon the leather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have we here, my friend? The lady in
the grey gown looks as though she would kill you an she
could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard laughed, and glanced at Etoile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is our Lady of the Woods, sire, a saint whom
the boors worship. Yet I might swear that she has
more than her scourge, her stone bed, and her cross in
that cell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etoile’s black eyes covered Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does a saint carry such a fleece of hair,” she
sneered. “This man-chase pleases me better and
better, sire. See how Madame Dorcas is standing on live
coals!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed, and looked at Denise, tilting her chin,
her eyes inquisitively insolent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have the door opened, sire, and let us see what her
man is like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter of Savoy glanced shrewdly at Etoile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How fair women love one another! Rosamond’s
cup is always ready to the hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had drawn back close to the door of the cell,
and stood leaning against the wall under the shadow
of the overhanging thatch. Her hair seemed to burn
under that band of shade like stormy sunlight under a
ragged cloud. Her hands were folded over her bosom,
her brown eyes fixed on the white forehead of Etoile’s
horse. There was no furtiveness about her face, no
flickering of a half confessed shame. The open space
between her and Gaillard’s men seemed to symbolise
something, perhaps an awe of her that made these rough
men of the sword hold back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etoile pointed with her bow towards the door, and
her eyes challenged Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps our Holy Sister will satisfy us with an
oath,” she said. “For the lips of a saint cannot utter
a lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise answered her nothing, and Etoile’s face darkened
maliciously under her golden caul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you lay me a wager, sire?” and she tapped
Peter of Savoy on the knee with her bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes gleamed at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A star is made wise by the stars; I keep an open
mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then have the door opened, and let us see whether
this good woman cannot hide a lover.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter of Savoy nodded towards the cell, and Gaillard
wheeled his horse, catching a glimpse of Denise’s white
and waiting face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roland, Jean, Guillaume!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His strident voice rang out. The three men stood
forward with their eyes fixed on him. Gaillard pointed
with his sword to the door of the cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Open it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They turned to obey him, one of the fellows forcing
the door back with the point of his sword, all three of
them upon the alert with their shields forward as though
expecting the rush of armed men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door had swung back showing nothing but a
shadowy interior, a dark and deep recess in the midst
of the day’s sunlight. The three men craned their heads
over their shields. Gaillard heeled his horse forward,
and ordered the men aside. Stooping low in the saddle
he looked into the cell, his face lean and intent, his eyes
like the eyes of a suspicious dog. At first he could distinguish
nothing. Then he laughed very softly, straightened
in the saddle, and looked down at Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps, Sister, your bed works miracles!” he
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed a little more loudly, his mouth mocking
her, his eyes sparkling over the humbling of her pride.
The three men began to laugh also. The pother seemed
as infectious as the cackling in a farmyard; the dogs
opened their mouths, and bayed; the wood became full
of stupid, Bacchic mirth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etoile laughed as loudly as any of the men, yet with
a metallic hardness that was not beautiful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is a quaint tale,” she said. “Who is it,
the lord of Goldspur, did someone say? She has prayed
over him like a saint!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman’s shrill laughter stung Denise like the
lash of a whip. Her lips moved, but she said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were all laughing, and looking upon Denise
when a man appeared in the doorway of the cell. He
was unarmed, with reddened bandages about one shoulder,
and his white face blazed out from the shadows as though
all the wrath in the world burnt like a torch behind
his eyes. There was something so grim and scornful
about that face that the men nearest him fell back,
silenced, repulsed, crowding upon one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery came out into the sunlight. He looked
right and left, his eyes sweeping the circle of rough faces,
and leaving on each the mark of his sharp contempt.
Gaillard alone had a smile upon his face. He sat in the
saddle with his sword over his shoulder, and pouted out
his lips as though to whistle. Denise had not turned
her head. Yet it was as though she were trying to look
at Aymery without betraying the quest of her brown
eyes, for Etoile was watching her with a sneer lifting the
corners of her mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery glanced up at the Gascon, and then beyond
him towards Lord Peter and the lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is our friend who ran away from us two nights
ago,” he said. “I hope you were happy, sir, hiding
under a lady’s bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s knees shook under him, and his eyes had
turned to grey steel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If your heart and mouth are foul,” he said, “make
no boast thereof, my hireling. God give me the chance
some day, and I will choke you with those words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held his head high, and looked Gaillard in the
eyes. But the strength was ebbing from him; he had
lost more blood. Two of the Gascon’s men caught him
by the arms as he began to totter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etoile touched Count Peter with her bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man has courage in him. We have bated him
enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lord of the castles smiled like a cynic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We men are so deserving of pity, we are such fine
fellows! Lend him your horse, my desire!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter of Savoy laid a hand over his heart, looking
at Etoile under half-closed lids as though she were a
child to be humoured. He gave Gaillard his orders.
A spare horse was led forward, and Aymery lifted into the
saddle. He held to the pommel with both hands, trying
to steady himself, a confusion of faces before his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wine, and I shall not hinder you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A horn set with silver and closed with an ivory lid,
passed from hand to hand. It had come from the wallet
that hung from Etoile’s saddle. A soldier held it to
Aymery’s mouth, steadying him with one arm. Aymery
drank, his hand shaking, so that the red wine stained his
chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, friend, for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave the horn back again, raised his head, and
looked round him for Denise. She was still leaning
against the wall of the cell. Their eyes met for a moment
in one quick look that left sadness and joy and pain in
the hearts of both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard’s voice rang out. A horn screamed. Dogs,
men, and horses moved suddenly like a crowd that has
been held behind a barrier. Etoile remained motionless
upon her horse, watching the men pass by her with
Aymery in their midst. Already Gaillard’s red surcoat
beaconed towards the gloom of the beech wood, the
sun shining upon it so that it looked the colour of
blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter of Savoy loitered beyond the trampled garden,
waiting for Etoile, and wondering what whim kept her
near the cell. The men had streamed away before she
turned her horse and walked the beast slowly past Denise.
And she stared at Denise boldly as she passed, her black
eyes mocking her from the vantage of her horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sweet dreams to you, Holy Sister!” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she rode on laughing, and leapt her horse over
the wattle fence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise stood there motionless, her face bleak and cold,
her eyes looking into the distance as though they saw
and understood nothing. Suddenly her face blazed
with a rush of blood. She hung her head, and
seemed to be praying.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER X</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>So briskly did the Lord of Pevensey sweep the woods
that Maytide, hunting his enemies with horn and hound,
that he drove such mesne lords as had drawn the sword
beyond his borders into other parts. The mere gentleman
and the yeoman could make no fight of it as yet
against a great lord who held the castles. The peasants
were cowed by the lances of the troopers; a few still
lurked in the deeps of the woods, chased hither and
thither like wild things that fly from the cry of the hound.
The finer and fiercer spirits fled with savage thoughts
in their hearts, counting on the day when their chance
should come again. Waleran de Monceaux took refuge
in Winchelsea, and joined himself to the men of that
town. Others galloped away to seek Earl Simon, and
to ease their wrath under De Montfort’s banner. As
for Grimbald the priest, he lay near to death, hidden
near a swineherd’s hovel, stricken with the wounds that
he had gotten him at Goldspur manor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Waleran de Monceaux, that man of the fierce
face and the bristling beard, fled to Winchelsea town,
he rode by the Abbey of Battle as the dawn was breaking
and halted there and called for food. He and his men
had touched neither meat nor bread for a day and a
night. Some were wounded, all of them ragged, famished,
and caked with the mire of the woodland ways. The
hosteler looked sulkily at these savage and beaten men.
Love them he could not because of their importunity,
and their great hunger. And while they cursed him
because of his slowness, he sent word to the Abbot,
desiring his commands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abbot Reginald’s message came to him with curt
good sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feed them, and be rid of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Waleran and his men had their paunches filled,
because Reginald of Battle was a man of discretion
and desired to keep his lands untainted. There were
sundry inconveniences that clung even to the right
of sanctuary and such high prerogatives. Reginald of
Brecon was a smooth and astute man, a fine farmer,
and keen as any Lombard. He would have no neighbour’s
sparks from over the hedge setting fire to his own
hayrick. If fools quarrelled, he could pray for both
parties, and hold up the Cross benignantly, provided no
one came trampling his crops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In those days Dom Silvius was almoner at the Abbey,
a quiet, sharp-faced, gliding mortal, very devout yet
very shrewd. Men said that Dom Silvius loved his
“house” better than he loved his soul. Never was a
mouse more quick to scent out peas. He knew the
ploughlands in every manor, every hog in every wood,
how much salt each pan should yield, the value of the
timber and the underwood, the measure of the corn ground
at the mills, the honey each hive yielded, the number of
fish that might be taken from the stews. The Abbey’s
charter, and each and every several bequest might have
been written on Dom Silvius’s brain. He was ever on
the alert, ever contriving, and such a man was to be
encouraged. His brethren loved him, for he was not
miserly towards the “girdle,” and their pittances
were bettered by Dom Silvius’s briskness. What
did it matter if a monk meddled with more than
concerned him, provided the buildings were in good
repair, and his brethren had red wine to warm their
bellies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dom Silvius’s ears were always open. He was a
quiet man who did not frighten folk, but he learnt their
secrets, and he often touched their money. Few lawyers
could have snatched a grant from under the almoner’s
cold, white fingers. He was a man of foresight, and of
some imagination. Property to him was not merely a
matter of so many plough teams and so many hides,
pannage for hogs, and grindings at the mill. The Church
held all charters in the land of the Spirit; she could
take toll from the lay folk, and make them pay for using
her road to heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very day that Waleran rode through Battle,
Dom Silvius walked with folded arms and bowed head
into the Abbot’s parlour. He stood meekly within the
door, his face full of a smooth humility, his eyes fixed
upon the rushes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abbot Reginald trusted greatly in this monk. The
man was ever courteous and debonair, never turbulent
or facetious, always inspired for the “glory” of his
“house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The blessing of the day, Brother. What business
lies between us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dom Silvius lifted his eyes for the first time to his
superior’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I repeat myself, Father, my importunity is an
earnest failing. It concerns the Red Saint for whom
Olivia of Goldspur built a cell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald of Brecon leant back in his chair, and
closed the book that he had been reading.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The woman whom they call Denise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius looked demure, as though his sanctity were
especially sensitive where a woman was concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her fame has become very great these months,”
he said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You covet it, Silvius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The almoner bowed his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I grudge no soul its good works, Father. But in
these days of burnings, and of spilling of blood——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The woods have grown perilous, Silvius, with Lord
Peter’s men abroad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the very truth, sir. There is no place safe
outside the sanctuaries. I have heard it said that the
Prior of Mickleham has offered protection to the
woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abbot Reginald smiled, the smile of a philosopher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak your thoughts, brother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius spread his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The woman is certainly a saint,” he said. “It
is common report that she has worked many and strange
cures. And, lord, with the foresight of faith I look
towards the future. From simple beginnings great
things have arisen. We do not draw pilgrims here—to
our Abbey. How much glory, sir, has the altar of
Canterbury won by the swords of those violent men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald of Brecon saw Dom Silvius’s vision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A hundred years hence, brother, we shall be blessed
through the relics of St. Denise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius had no mistrust of his inspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The maid is certainly miraculous,” he said. “We
could grant her a cell within our bounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He of the mitre put the tips of his fingers in opposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our brethren of Mickleham or of Robertsbridge
would forestall us, if they could?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They love their ‘houses,’ Father, and for that I
praise them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worthy men! Where would you lodge her, Silvius?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is that stone cot near Mountjoye, sir, with
the croft below it. We could set up a cross there that
would be seen from the road. If the maid can but work
miracles here, people will flock to her; then gifts can
be laid upon our altar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden clangour of bells from the tower brought
the almoner’s audience to an end. Reginald of Brecon
rose, and laid aside his book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does the woman say?” he asked, touching
the core of Silvius’s conception.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, lord, must be discovered. If I have your
grace in this——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go, Brother, and prosper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Silvius went out noiselessly from the parlour,
his hands hidden in the sleeves of his habit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the may was whitening in the woods, and
the blue bells spread an azure mist above the green,
May was a harsh and rugged month that year, with north
winds blowing, and the sky hard and grey. And Dom
Silvius when he mounted a quiet saddle horse and trotted
away followed by two servants, drew his thick cloak
about him, and was glad of his gloves and his lamb’s-wool
stockings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up in the beech wood above Goldspur the wind
made a restless moan through the branches of the trees.
Sometimes the sun struck through the racing clouds, and
a wavering chequer of light and shadow fell on the thin
forest grass. There was a shimmer of young green everywhere,
yet the year seemed sad and plaintive as though
chilled to heart by the north winds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise, wrapped in her grey cloak, wandered that
morning along the grass paths of her trampled garden,
brooding over the wreck thereof. Here were her thyme
and lavender bushes trodden under foot, or snapped and
shredded by the browsing teeth of a horse. Crushed
plants peered at her pathetically from the pits where
hoofs had sunk into the soft soil; a bed of pansies seemed
to scowl at her with their quaint and many-coloured faces,
as though reviling her for having brought such barbarians
to trample them. Almost the whole of the wattle fence
had fallen, dragging down into the dirt the roses that had
been trained to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet never had Denise’s garden been a more intimate
part of herself than that May morning with the wind
tossing the beech boughs against a heavy sky. What a
change from yesterday, what a breaking in of violent
life, what revelations, what regret! The quiet days
seemed behind her, far in the distance, for the vivid
present had made even the near past seem unreal. As
for her own heart, Denise was almost afraid to look therein.
It was like her garden, with the barriers broken, and the
life of yesterday trodden into the soil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had tried to put these passionate things from
her, and to turn again to the life that she had known.
There were a hundred things for her hands to do, but
do them she could not, for the will in her seemed dead.
Even the familiar trifles of her woodland hermitage were
full of treachery and of suggestive guile. Her bed,
Aymery had lain there. Her earthen pitcher, she had
brought him water therein. The very stones of the
path still seemed to show to her the stains of the man’s
blood. Memories were everywhere, memories that would
not vanish, and would not pale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s face still burnt when she remembered
Etoile’s laughter, that hard, metallic laughter like the
clash of cymbals. The woman’s insolence showed her
the mocking face of the world, yet for the life of her,
Denise could not tear her thoughts from the happenings
of those two days. Had the whole country risen to jeer
at her, she could have suffered it because of the mystery
that made of the ordeal a sacrifice. She had not saved
the man, and yet she did not grudge all that she had
borne, all that she still might bear. The violence of
yesterday had opened the woman’s eyes in Denise.
The world had a new strangeness, and the chant of the
wind a more plaintive meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been unable to sleep with thinking of Aymery,
and of what had befallen him, for she still seemed to
see his white, furious face, throwing its scorn into the
scoffing mouths of the Gascon’s men. Nor could she
forget the last look that had passed between them, the
appeal in the man’s eyes as though he would have said
to her: “God forgive me, for all this.” Where were
they taking him, would they be rough with him, would
he die of his wounds upon the road? What offence
had he committed that his house should be burnt, and
his life hazarded, and who was this Peter of Savoy,
this Provençal that he should lord it over the men of
the land, claiming to act for his over-lord the King?
It was the right of the strong over the weak, the pride
of the men who held the castles crushing those who
refused to be exploited. The curse of a weak King
was over the country. These hawks of his whom he
had let loose in England obeyed no one, not even their
own lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Denise’s conscience took scourge in hand at
last, and drove her from her broodings and her visions.
Work, something to fill the mind, something tangible
to fasten the hands upon! What did it avail her to
loiter, to dream, and to conjecture? There was no
salvation in mere feeling. Her heart was turning to
wax in her, she who had worked for others, and who
had been knelt to as a saint. A rush of shame smote
her upon the bosom. The peasant women, these men
of the fields, what would they think of her if they could
read her thoughts? She had held up the Cross
before their eyes, and was forgetting to look at it
herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Denise drove herself to work that morning, lifting
the fallen fence and propping it with stakes, gathering
the wreckage, binding up the broken life of the place.
It eased her a little this labour under the grey sky, with
the wind in the woods, and the smell of the soil. For
in simple things the heart finds comfort, and idleness is
no salve to the soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was about noon when Dom Silvius came to the
clearing in the beech wood, and Denise, who was binding
up her trailing roses, saw figures moving amid the trees.
Her brown eyes were alert instantly as the eyes of a deer.
But there was nothing fierce about Dom Silvius’s figure,
and nothing martial or masterful about the paces of
his horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The almoner left the two servants under the woodshaw
and rode forward slowly over the grass. Silvius’s
eyes had a habit of seeing everything, even when they
happened to express a vacant yet inspired preoccupation.
He saw the scarred turf, the hoof marks everywhere,
the broken fence about the garden, the woman in the
grey cloak at work upon her roses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius kept a staid and thoughtful face till he had
come close to the hermitage. Then his eyes beamed
out suddenly as though he had only just discovered
Denise behind the spring foliage of her roses. And
Dom Silvius could put much sweetness into his smile
so that his face shone like the face of a saint out of an
Italian picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace to you, Sister; we were nearer than I
prophesied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise lifted her head and looked at him. A rose
tendril had hooked a thorn in the cloth of her cloak.
And to Silvius as he gazed down into the questioning
brown of her eyes, that thorn seemed to point a moral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I come as a friend,” he said, hiding his curiosity
behind smooth kindness. “Silvius the almoner of the
Abbey of Battle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have heard of you, Father,” she answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius smiled, as though there were no such thing
as spite and gossip in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May my grace fly as far as yours, Sister,” he said.
“You are wondering why I have ridden hither? Well,
I will tell you. It is because of the rumours of violence
and of bloodshed that have come to us. Even here,
I see that you have not been spared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked about him gravely, yet with no inquisitive,
insinuating briskness. His eyes travelled slowly round
the circle of the broken fence, and came to point at last
upon Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have come with brotherly greetings to you, Sister,
from Lord Reginald our Abbot. All men know what a
light has burnt here these many months upon the hills.
It is a holy fire to be cherished by us, and all men would
grieve to see it dimmed or quenched.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some such preamble he began to speak softly to
Denise, for he was a good soul despite his shrewdness,
and the woman’s face was like a face out of heaven.
He put the simple truth before her, speaking with a devout
fatherliness that betrayed no subtler motive. Peace
should be hers, and a sure sanctuary, roof, clothes, bed,
and garden, and a daily corrody from the Abbey. The
times were full of violence, lust, and oppression, and
Silvius feared for those far from the protecting shadow
of some great lord or priest. At Battle she should
enjoy all the sweetness of sanctity; she should have
even her flowers there, and he waved a hand towards
the ruinous garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise listened to him with a pale and unpersuaded
face. Perhaps a flicker of distrust had leapt up at first
into her eyes. But the monk’s simplicity seemed so
sincere a thing that she put distrust out of her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had ended, she looked towards the woods
in silence for a while, and Silvius made no sound, as
though he reverenced her silence, and understood its
earnestness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For all this I thank you, Father,” she said at last.
“But come to you I cannot. It is not in my heart to
leave this place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius smiled down at her very patiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who shall deny that the Spirit must guide you. Yet
even St. Innocence may remember what God has given.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise reddened momentarily, and Silvius looked
away from her towards the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not a child, Father,” she said simply. “The
people in these parts love me, and I, them. They will
return home in time, and will come and seek for me.
I should seem to them the worst of cowards, if they found
that I had fled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius was too sensitive and too shrewd to press his
importunity upon her, seeing that she was prejudiced
in her heart. He could leave her to think over what he
had said to her. Her pride might refuse to waver at
the first skirmish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are living your life for others, Sister,” he said.
“Nor do we live in the midst of a wilderness at Battle.
Trust the Spirit in you; do not be misled. Yet I would
beseech you to remember what manner of world this is.
Had not St. Paul fled from the city of Damascus, the
Faith would have lacked a flame of fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise looked up at him with miraculous eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet, I would stay here,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So be it, Sister; some day I will ride this way
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Denise sent Dom Silvius away, clinging with all
this strange new tenderness of hers to a place that seemed
sacred by reason of its memories. Yet if she had known
what others knew, or guessed what was passing beyond
her ken, she might have fled with Silvius that day, and
left her cell to the wild winds, the sun, and the rain.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>It was possible for such a man as Gaillard to be in love
with two women at one and the same moment, if indeed
what Gaillard felt for a woman could be called love.
Peter of Savoy was at Lewes, and the Gascon had the
command at Pevensey, and had taken to oiling his hair,
and having musk sewn up in a corner of his surcoat.
He and Etoile saw much of one another, but the lute
girl knew how to keep Gaillard at arm’s length. He
might play the troubadour, and make himself ridiculous
by singing under her window at night. Etoile wished to
try the man further before she trusted such a cousin
as Gaillard with her power over Count Peter of Savoy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing Etoile did not know, that Gaillard had
ridden more than once to the beech wood above Goldspur,
and that he had seen Denise, and come away feeling
baulked and foolish. The Red Saint had shut herself
obstinately in her cell, and as for singing her love songs,
even Gaillard had not the gross conceit to treat Denise
as he would have treated Etoile. Yet Gaillard had no
sense of the comic in life, and accepted himself with
such enthusiasm that anything was possible to so blatant
a creature. Display was a passion with him, and any
clouding of his conceit, an injury that made him scowl
like a spoilt child. Life had to be full of noise and
bustle, the blowing of trumpets, and the applause of
women. Gaillard was so much in love with himself
that he ran about like a fanatic waving a torch, and
expecting all the world to listen to what he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Gascon might be a fool, but he was a pernicious
fool in those rough days, when there was a woman to
be pleased. Denise had shut her door on him, but Gaillard
did not doubt but that she would open it in due season.
Her pride was a thing on the surface, so Gaillard told
himself, and she had more to surrender than had most
women. Etoile also was unapproachable, but in very
different fashion to Denise. The one was a white glare
that blinded and repulsed, the other a glittering point
that lured and kept its distance. And Gaillard, like a
great gross red moth, blundered to and fro, making a
great flutter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etoile had much of the spirit of those Byzantine
women who had the devil’s poison under their tongues.
Gaillard amused her. It pleased her to discover how
far she could drive him into making a fool or a cur of
himself, even as she might tease Count Peter’s leopards,
playing on their jealousy, or tantalising them by holding
out food and snatching it away between the bars. And
Etoile’s ingenuity searched out an adventure that should
show her how far Gaillard could be trusted. She was
shrewd enough to realise that the man might be of use
to her. Peter of Savoy was but a child with a play-thing.
It was worth Etoile’s discretion to have a man
upon whom she could rely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard grew more importunate, and was for ever
offering her his homage. “Well,” said Etoile to herself,
“let him prove himself, but not in the matter of brute
courage.” She knew that it is always more dangerous
for a man to be tempted than to be dared. And Etoile
gave Gaillard a tryst at dusk among the cypresses of
Count Peter’s garden, and turning on him like a cat
challenged Gaillard to prove his faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No man was ever more astonished than the Gascon
when she told him what she would have him do. At
first he hailed the devil of mischief in her, but Etoile
was in earnest, and flamed up when he laughed at her.
Gaillard shrugged his shoulders, and saw destiny stirring
the live coals of his desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be simpler to bring you her head,” he said,
wondering whether Etoile knew more than she had betrayed.
“Cut off the woman’s hair, indeed! The
folk yonder would crucify me, if they caught me harming
their saint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etoile looked him in the eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are for ever shouting at me to prove you
my Gaillard. Here is your chance. There is often some
wisdom in a whim. You are to bring me her wooden
cross, too, remember, as well as a piece of her
hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard, uneasy under Etoile’s eyes, hid his more
intimate thoughts behind an incredulous obstinacy. He
could have scoffed at the absurdity of the thing. And
yet, when he looked at it squarely, the adventure was
not so physically absurd. What did it mean but the
robbing of one woman to win another, the plundering
of one treasure house to use the spoil to bribe the keeper
of other treasures! The fine rascality of the thing
delighted him. He threw back his head and laughed,
though Etoile mistook the meaning of his laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have not the courage, Gaillard, eh? The man
who sings under my window must be something better
than a troubadour fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard bit his nails as though in the grip of a dilemma.
The devil in him applauded. He could have clapped
himself on the back over the broad humour of his cleverness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a road to set a man on, my desire,” he said,
looking rather sullen over it. “There is a sin that they
call sacrilege——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etoile clapped her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cousin Gaillard with a conscience! Oh, you fool,
am I worth a piece of hair, and the wood of a cross?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard spread his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool! Do you think that I want a man with
weak knees to serve me, a boy who empties half the cup
and then turns sick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard made a show of faltering, rocking to and
fro on his heels, and looking at her under half closed
lids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly,” said he, “you are a devil. And to win
a devil I will rob a saint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s inward vision helped her so little those days
that she had no foreshadowings of Gaillard’s treachery.
He had shown none of his rougher nature to her when
he had ridden through the beech wood to her cell. And
Denise had let him talk to her once or twice, intent on
discovering all that had befallen Aymery since he had
fallen into the hands of Peter of Savoy. Only when
Gaillard had tried to come too near had she closed the
door on him, frightened by the look in the man’s eyes,
and yet feeling herself very helpless in that solitary wood.
For some days she had seen nothing of the Goldspur
folk, nor did she know whether Grimbald was dead or
alive. Gaillard had gone off sulking from the frost that
she had thrown out on him. Denise believed herself
rid of the man. And yet in her unrest, and loneliness,
she thought of what Dom Silvius had said to her, and was
half persuaded to put herself within sanctuary at Battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard had told her nothing about Aymery, save
that he was alive, and waiting the King’s pleasure.
And of all these happenings Aymery knew nothing as
he lay on the straw in a tower room at Pevensey. His
wounds were mending, for Peter of Savoy had some of
the instincts of a Christian, and had sent his own barber
surgeon to minister to Aymery’s needs. Yet the lord
of Goldspur manor thought little of his own wounds those
days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Aymery’s flesh was free from fever, the spirit
chafed in him, tossing and turning with an unceasing
flux of thought. Those happenings at the hermitage
haunted him, and in the spirit he drank wine that was
both bitter and sweet, cursing himself for the helplessness
that had brought such things to pass, and laying to his
own charge all the shame that had fallen upon Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Aymery had other thoughts to trouble him, for
those hours at the hermitage came back more clearly
and vividly, as though they had happened in the twilight,
and been remembered in the day. He felt again the touch
of Denise’s hands, saw the gleam of her hair, and caught
the mystery of tenderness that had flashed and faded in
the deeps of her eyes. Aymery would be very still in
the narrow room, still as one who lies dead with a smile
on his lips, and in blind eyes a vision of things splendid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes Aymery would take to preaching to himself,
growing sensible and almost prosy, like a merchant looking
methodically into his ledgers. Without doubt Grimbald
would be at Goldspur, the people would come back to
the village, they would think no shame of Denise, even
if they heard of the thing that she had attempted. The
quiet life would begin again, for there was no cause now
for my Lord Peter to harry the countryside. No harm
might come of all these adventures, and to insure that
end, Aymery preached to himself still further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heart of mine,” said he. “Denise is for no such
worldly desires. True, she has taken no sworn vows,
but for all that, my friend, she is as good as a nun. Take
heed how you tempt sacrilege. For to the people Denise
is a lady of many marvels. She is not of mere clay,
there is mystery yonder—and her love is the love of the
angels and the saints.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In some such simple and sturdy fashion Aymery
spoke often to his own heart. Yet there was always
an enchanted distance shining beyond these vows of
his like a sunset seen through trees. Flashes of passion
lingered that should not linger. A look of the eyes,
a touch of the hand, such things are not forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for his own fortune, Aymery had no grip thereon;
he could only eat his food and shake up the straw of his
bed for comfort. He was mewed there, “waiting the
King’s pleasure,” a useful phrase in the mouth of a lord
who shared with others in persuading the King. Aymery
might have stood at his window and shouted “Charter”
till the barber surgeon decreed that he was turgid and
feverish, and should be bled. There was no such thing
as a rescue to be thought of. Presently he might scheme
at breaking out in other and grimmer fashion if they did
not release him. For there was still much talk in the
land of “Stephen’s days,” and it was said that when the
saints saved a soul, the devil erected a castle.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had some sign at last from the Goldspur folk,
for she found that offerings had been left at her gate,
and since her store of food had fallen to half a very dry
loaf and a pot of honey, she was carnally glad of such a
godsend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening of the same day while she was at work
in her garden, two of Aymery’s villeins came out of the
wood, each carrying a bundle of ash stakes and an axe,
for they had heard that the saint’s fence was as flat in
places as the walls of Jericho. The two men, Oswald
and Peter, were a little shy of Denise, as though the
Goldspur conscience had accused the community of
neglecting the Red Saint. They told her that the cattle
had broken out from the pen, and strayed far and wide
through the woods. It had taken them days to recover
the beasts, and they had been hampered by the knowledge
that the men of Pevensey were still sweeping the hundreds
of the rape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both of the men knew that Aymery was a prisoner
at Pevensey, but they did not know that he had been
taken at the very doorway of the Red Saint’s cell. Nor
did Denise betray to them all that had passed; she had
too much pride and a sacred sense of secrecy for that.
Oswald and Peter set to work, their axes catching the
sunlight that sifted through the trees, white chips flying,
their brown faces intent and stolid. Denise stood and
watched them for a time, and Oswald, the elder of the
two, told her what had befallen Father Grimbald. A
swineherd had found him half dead in the woods, and
had hidden him in a saw-pit for fear of Gaillard and his
men. It had been a sharp escape, and a sharp sickness
for Grimbald. He was still in hiding, and being healed
of his wounds, and there was not a woman in the whole
hundred who would not have had her tongue cut out
rather than betray Grimbald to Peter of Savoy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dusk was falling before the men had finished mending
the fence, and a wind had risen like a restless and plaintive
voice, making the twilight seem more grey and melancholy.
The whole beech wood had begun to shiver with a sense
of loneliness that made the earth itself seem cold. Oswald
and Peter knelt down before Denise, and asked her to
bless them before they shouldered their axes and marched
off into the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men followed the winding path that struck
the main “ride” running through the heart of the wood,
and they walked fast because of the twilight, and because
it was believed that the wood was haunted. For the
wilds were the haunts of the evil things of the night,
and when a saint lived a holy life in such a place she
was sure of being tempted and vexed by devils. The
tale of St. Guthlac of Crowland was a tale that was told
of many a saint. When the lamp of sanctity was lit
in some such wilderness the spirits of evil would fly
at it in fury, and seek to beat it out with the rush of
their black wings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oswald and Peter were no more superstitious than
their neighbours, but they were as timid as children in
the thick of that dark wood. And to frighten their
credulity a strange sound seemed on the gallop with the
gusts of the wind, a sound that was like the trampling
of a horse under the sad gloom of the trees. The sound
came so uncomfortably near to them, that Oswald and
Peter bolted into the underwood like a couple of brown
rabbits. And looking back half furtively, as they
scrambled through brambles and under hazels, they had
a glimpse of a great black shape rushing through the
darkness on the wings of the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men did not wait to see more of it, but
got out of the wood as fast as their legs could carry
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a ghost or a devil,” they said to one another.
“God defend us, but surely it is a terrible thing to be
a saint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They pushed on, heartily glad to be free of the far-reaching
hands of the spectral trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was good for us that we had the saint’s blessing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God and St. Martin hearten her. The devil vexes
those who live for good works.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father Grimbald must know of it. He is man
enough to come and take a devil by the beard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Oswald and Peter went back to their womenfolk
and their cattle, glad to be near warm bodies, snug under
their woodland huts. The night passed, and the dawn
came, a slow, stealthy dawn muffled in silver mist. Rabbits
scampered in the glades, brushing the dew from the wet
grass. Birds hunted for worms, and fluttered away to
feed their young. And the devil whom Oswald and
Peter had seen, sent the rabbits bolting for their burrows
as he rode away through the beech wood towards the
sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before noon Etoile the lute girl had a wreath of hair
curled like a snake about the little wooden cross in her
lap. Gaillard had brought them to her, hiding a guilty
memory in the eyes behind a laughing swagger. The
Gascon’s voluble tongue was driven to deal very fancifully
with the adventure, since Etoile was very curious, and
intent on hearing everything. The Red Saint was very
ready to be worshipped, such was Gaillard’s explanation.
She was a little vainer than the majority of women,
and Gaillard shrugged his shoulders and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A red apple is always a red apple,” he said. “Mother
Eve taught us that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mischievous devil in Etoile was not yet satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never trust a saint, Gaillard,” she said. “I have
not forgotten that the man in the tower might be glad
of this piece of hair. It will give him something to
think about while he sits and nibbles straws. Take it
up and push it under his door, and tell him it comes
from his lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The joke caught Gaillard’s fancy. He climbed the
tower, and pushed the trophy under Aymery’s door
with the point of his poniard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A woman gave it me, my man,” he said. “But
since I have something better for a keepsake, you can
have the hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went away, laughing, a thorough Gascon in his
gross self-satisfaction. And Aymery picked up what
Gaillard had left him. He knew it for Denise’s hair,
for there was none like it in all those parts.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The may was budding into bloom, and Dom Silvius
came riding Goldspur way again, thinking of the many
things that may occupy the mind of a man who keeps
both eyes fixed upon the affairs of the “house.” Silvius’s
soul felt very comfortable within him that morning.
The bloom was setting well upon the orchard trees,
such a sea of foam that the autumn should be red with
fruit. Word had come from the shepherds in the pasture
lands that hardly a lamb had been lost that spring.
There was little sickness anywhere, but few poor to
need alms, and no shortage of dues from the tenants.
Dom Silvius made it his business to know of all these
things, even though they might not concern his authority.
He was like a child and a miser in his joy and carefulness
in working for the wealth and honour of his Abbey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Dom Silvius came to the beech wood above Goldspur,
and followed the main ride, talking to himself
like a happy starling, for he rode alone that morning.
And he would lean forward and fondle his nag’s ears,
for the beast was provided by one of the tenants, and
Dom Silvius loved the horse because he had not to feed
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little more roundly, my good Dobbin,” he
prattled. “But beware of worldliness, for the sake
of my dignity; we must not bump like a butcher to
market. What will Sancta Denise say to us this morning?
The child should not set herself alone here like
a white dove for any hawk to swoop at. <span class='it'>Mea culpa</span>,
but the girl has hair like dead beech leaves touched by
the sun, saving, Dobbin, that the leaves have no glitter
of gold. And what eyes! God bless us, but we may
hope for miracles. And if the folk flock to be healed,
they shall lodge in the Abbey, and surely their gratitude
will make us rich.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The almoner sobered himself however when he turned
aside by the white stone that marked the path leading
to the hermitage. The woodlands might have eyes and
ears, and it would not be seemly for a man of Silvius’s
age and estate to be overheard babbling like a lover
who must talk even though it be only to his horse. So
he rode very demurely into Denise’s glade, with his chin
on his chest, and his lips moving as though he said a
prayer for every furlong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door of Denise’s cell was shut, nor could Dom
Silvius see her stirring in her garden. “Perhaps she is
abroad,” thought he, “or maybe she is at her prayers,”
so he rode up quietly, dismounted, and looped his bridle
over the post of the wicket gate. Then he went in and
up the path, and was about to knock softly, when the
door opened under his very hand, and Silvius saw a
figure in grey standing upon the threshold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dom Silvius dropped his eyes suddenly as though
he blamed himself for being surprised into staring at a
woman’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The grace of Our Lady to you, Sister,” he said.
“I was in doubt whether I should find you at home or
no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Silvius was not a shred embarrassed, though
he pretended to a kind of saintly coyness. He had
his eyes on the sandalled feet that showed under the
hem of the grey gown. They were very comely feet,
with the brown straps of the sandals contrasting with
the nut brown of the skin, and Dom Silvius was thinking
how different these feet were with their arched insteps
and straight toes from the gouty and behumped members
that shuffled and progressed in the Abbey cloisters.
Yet in looking at Denise’s feet the almoner missed the
first shadows of a tragedy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise stood very still, her hood drawn forward,
one hand holding the edge of the door. The face under
the hood expressed nothing, if despair be nothing more
than a pale, mute mask. Yet the eyes that looked at
the monk were the eyes of one whose blood was full of
a spiritual fever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Dom Silvius?” she asked at last, and her
voice sounded steady and even tame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius folded his hands together, and raised his
eyes to the level of Denise’s knees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may remember, my Sister, how I said that I
might ride this way again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was silent, as though absorbed by some memory
that pervaded all her consciousness. Silvius’s eyes
climbed a little higher and rested upon her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We did not agree then, Sancta Denise. It may be
that you still love the life in the wilderness. The winter
is past with us, for which God be thanked; you will
have summer here, and the woods are pleasant in
summer. Perhaps you have your birds to feed.
The fruit promises well. I am never one for importunities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke like a man who had rushed too quickly
towards the point aimed at, and who covered up his
retreat with irrelevancies. For Dom Silvius felt that
his wisdom had slipped for the once, and that he should
have begun with a digression. Women like love tokens
hidden in a posy of flowers, and passion pledged in a
song. But Denise’s directness saved Silvius from tracking
her whims through a maze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your words have been with me,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice surprised him, so much so that he looked
up sharply into her face. The hood was drawn, but an
immovable mute pallor, a kind of deadness, struck on
Silvius’s eyes like the whiteness of a whitened wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not unthankful for that, Sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you are of the same mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What God and the Church offer is ever an offer,”
he said, dropping his eyes again, and finding his intuition
in touch with something that was invisible, and yet to
be felt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He heard Denise draw her breath in deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes we seem wise, sometimes foolish,” she
said. “Life teaches the heart many things. You
offer me some such place as this to lodge in? And that
I shall be alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius threw aside vague conjectures, to seize the
prize he had long coveted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a sweet place,” said he. “With a garden,
and fruit trees, and a croft below it. The garden has
a good quick hedge all about it. As to the flesh, your
soul shall be as Solomon’s lily, Sanctissima. We have
no ritual for those whose eyes see into Paradise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So as the great purple cloud shadows drifted over the
young green of the beech wood, and the sun shone forth
with moments of gold, Dom Silvius warmed with his own
words, and in his kindling never so much as saw that
Denise listened like one who struggled against some inward
anguish. What light and shade were there over her own
soul as Silvius put his visions into his voice? The monk
thought her calm and sensible, a little cold perhaps, but
then the snow of her chastity would make her that.
Silvius was no coarse colourist, no noisy twanger of strings.
There should be mysticism, aloofness, a play of pearly
light about such a part. His exultation burnt delicate
flattery. For Silvius knew that many sacred souls
loved their sanctity as a gay quean loves her clothes.
How many Magdalenes were there who dreamt of being
seen while they washed the feet of God and the Saints!
And Silvius wished to lead this child of the Miraculous
Heart so that she should walk in a path of his own
conceiving, a sweet saint who should draw the
country, aye far countrysides, as the moon draws the
sea. The coming of Denise to the bounds of Battle
should be as the coming of the Bride to the Church of
God. It should be a pageant, and a poem. For in
those days pageantry preached to the people, and through
the eyes the heart was persuaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise heard him, like one very weary, one who
listens because there is no escape. And in good season
Silvius had the wit to see that he had pressed wine enough
for the day. Denise had given him her promise, and he
took his leave of her with sweetness, and all reverence,
putting himself beneath her, and speaking of her wishes
as commands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would their most blessed Sister take up her new
cell soon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise leant her weight against the door, feeling that
if she were not rid of Silvius she would drop at his feet
and weep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before the moon is full,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the monk mounted his horse, and rode away
like one who has received a pallium, dreaming miraculous
dreams, and beholding innumerable pilgrims, peasant
and prince, knight and lady, riding and journeying
towards Senlac over hill and dale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Denise she stood at the door of her cell long
after Silvius had left her, as though she lacked even
the power to move. What help was there, what other
means should she devise? This cell of stone had become
a den of evil dreams for her; the tenderness and mystery
had fled. She had no heart to live there any longer,
no heart to meet those who had knelt to her before this
thing had happened.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Since the fight at Goldspur Father Grimbald had lain
hidden in a saw-pit on one of the forest manors, the
swineherd who had hidden him being also woodman
and sawyer when his hogs were rooting amid the beech
mast and the acorns. Saw-dust with heather spread
over it made none so miserable a bed, and the swineherd
had fortified Grimbald against wind, rain, and the inquisitiveness
of enemies by covering the mouth of the
pit with faggots. For a month Grimbald had lain there,
his shirt and cassock clotted to great wounds that no
man dared to touch. At first a fever had taken him,
and he had roared and stormed at night like some sturdy
saint at grips with Apollyon in a corner of hell. The
swineherd had banked up the faggots to deaden the sound,
praying God to abate Father Grimbald’s fever, for a
dozen of Gaillard’s men were camped that very night
not two furlongs from the saw-pit. Yet Grimbald’s
shouts had come rumbling out of the earth, “Strike,
strike, St. George!” “Shine, brown bills, and beat the
Frenchmen into the sea!” And so strenuous and bellicose
had the fever grown in him, that the swineherd,
staking purgatory or peace on a pail of water, had lifted
the faggots and doused Grimbald to cool him. Nor had
any harm come of it, but rather good, for Grimbald
had grown less fiery, and fallen into a deep sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About the time that Dom Silvius made his second
pilgrimage to the beech wood above Goldspur, Grimbald
was so well recovered of his wounds that he could
sit up on his bed, and take his food with great relish.
Being also an industrious soul he made the swineherd
throw him down billets of seasoned oak, a knife, and
a hatchet, and set himself to carve heads of the saints
for decorating the corbels of his little church. But either
St. Paul and St. Simon were in an ill humour, or Grimbald
knew little of his craft, for the saints emerged pulling
most villainous faces, sour, evil, and grotesque, with
flat noses, and slits for eyes. So Grimbald gave up his
struggle with them, and heaved them up out of the pit
to be burnt, and took to pointing and feathering arrows,
for your woodlander was often his own fletcher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flesh prospering so well with him, and the end
of his sojourn in the saw-pit seeming near, Grimbald
sent the swineherd for some of the Goldspur folk. The
very same evening the swineherd brought in the two
men Oswald and Peter, both of them full to the brim
with gossip, and ready to empty themselves at their
spiritual father’s feet. Grimbald sat on his bed in the
pit, whittling a yew bough with his knife; Oswald
and Peter squatted side by side on a faggot like a couple
of solemn brown owls on a bough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father,” quoth Oswald, “we have seen the devil
in St. Denise’s wood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter chimed in to add to the impression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A black devil with a black horse that breathed
fire and smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he came and went like the wind, Father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even such honest men as these had imaginations
wherewith to decorate an experience. Grimbald’s face
looked the colour of brown earth in the darkness of the
pit, and to Oswald and Peter his eyeballs seemed to glare
like two white pebbles at the bottom of a well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you ran away from this devil?” he said.
“Yes, you ran, my sons, as fast as your legs could carry
you. When shall I come by a Christian who is not
afraid to stand on his own feet, and to astonish us by
making the devil run?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Grimbald scoffed at them, the two men knew
his methods. No one had anything to fear from Grimbald
so long as he looked him straight in the face and spoke
the simple truth. But a liar or a fawner were likely to
be thrashed, since Grimbald’s chastening of souls was
not wholly a matter of the tongue. He used his hands
like a Christian, and for the love of their flesh he did not
spare them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly, Father, it was the devil we saw in the
beech wood. Night was just falling——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So! And he was very black was he? Just as
black as charcoal, and had two live coals for eyes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good man’s grim irony drove neither Oswald
nor Peter from his breastwork of conviction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We would take oath it was the devil, Father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oswald, Oswald, you seem too familiar with the
face of Satan! You are too fond of the mead-horn, my
man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The accused one accepted the charge meekly, knowing
that it was true in the abstract, and that Father Grimbald
knew it, for there had been an occasion of second baptism
in a somewhat dirty ditch. But Oswald was stolidly
sure of his innocence on the night in question, nor had
he as yet finished his confessions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had no mead froth on my beard that day, Father,”
said he. “Whether it was the devil or no we saw, we
saw him with these eyes of ours. And he rode like a
black north wind. But what is worse, Father, we have
never had sight of our saint since then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was news that struck the irony out of Grimbald’s
mouth. He laid the yew bough aside on the heather,
and became at once the demi-god, and the seer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that you are saying, man Oswald? Why
are you troubled for Denise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oswald looked like a wise dog that has come by
kicks undeservedly, and is now to be commended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The door of the cell is always shut,” he said, “and
never a word or a sound have we now from our lady.
What is more, Father, the stuff we took there two days
ago was still by the wicket when one of the lads went
up this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald looked thoughtful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you tried the door?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We durst not, thinking she might be in a vision
or in prayer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you call to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not above asking her blessing, Father, and telling
of the food, and news of you. And it was four days
ago that her voice answered us, but since then we have
heard no sound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald stood up slowly on the bed, propping himself
with his arms against the walls of the pit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God helping me, I could sit a horse,” he said. “This
must be looked to. Oswald, my son, you had a fat pony.
Bring the beast here to-morrow, at dawn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall be done, Father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they departed with his blessing, but Grimbald
was awake all that night, troubled lest any harm should
have befallen Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Devil!” thought he. “Oswald’s devil was one
of good human kidney, or I have no sense of smell.
Satan need not heat himself with galloping in these
parts. We have enough of him in the flesh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile at Pevensey, Aymery of Goldspur had
thrown the preaching part of himself aside, for that
which Gaillard had thrust under his door had stung the
manhood in him, and left the poison of a great fear in
his blood. The hair was Denise’s hair; he could have
sworn to that on the relics of the Cross. How had they
come by it, here in Pevensey? Was Denise also a
caged bird, and if not, what had happened in that beech
wood, where the great trees built dark winding ways
with the sweep of their mighty branches? Aymery’s
thoughts plunged in amid those trees, grimly and passionately,
yet with the sheen of a woman’s hair luring him on
like the mystic light from the Holy Grael. Had evil
befallen her because of him? What devil’s mockery
might there be in the way the truth had been thrust
into his ken! Had Gaillard any hand in it? And at
the thought of Gaillard, Aymery twisted Denise’s hair
about his wrists, and yearned to feel those hands of his
leaping at the Gascon’s throat. God! What did it
avail him to pretend that he feared for Denise as he would
have feared for a sister? She was the ripe earth to him,
the dawn of dawns, the freshness of June woods after
rain. He could cover his eyes no longer as to what was
in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To break out into the world, to gallop a horse, to
feel his muscles in their strength, that was the fever in
him, the restless fever of a chained hawk beating his
wings upon a perch. To be out of this hole in a stone
tower, but how? He had no weapons, not so much
as a piece of wood, or the rag of a linen sheet. They
had taken his leather belt, but left him his shirt,
tunic and shoes, and he laughed despite his grimness,
for they might as well have left him naked. The man
who brought him bread and water, filled a cracked flask
for him, and took the water-pot away. And what a
weapon that great earthen jar would have made, swung
with the verve and sinew of a young man’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Impatient with his own impotence, he stood at the
narrow window looking seawards, drawing Denise’s hair
to and fro between his fingers as he would have drawn
a swath of silk. A thought came to him, but at first
he revolted from it as from a piece of sacrilege. His
sturdy sense saved him, however, from being fooled by a
shred of sentiment, and he twisted the strands of hair
till he had wound them into a fine and silken cord.
Wrapping the ends about his wrists he looped the cord
over his bent knee, tried the strength thereof, and smiled
as though satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening there was the sound of a scuffle when
the bread bringer drew back the bolts and pushed the
heavy door open with his foot. The fellow had made
light of his duty of late, for Aymery had seemed quiet
and tame, and still feeble after his wounds. He had
marched in perfunctorily while Aymery waited for him
behind the door. There was the crash of the pitcher
on the stones. The jailer’s knees gave under him; he
sank sideways driving the door to with his weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery had no wish to end the poor devil’s life, so
he left him there to get back breath and consciousness,
after robbing him of his rough cloak and the knife he
carried at his girdle. Pushing the body aside, he swung
the door to cautiously, and shot the bolts. Almost
instinctively he had wound Denise’s hair about his wrist,
and as he descended the winding stair he tossed the
man’s cloak over his shoulders, turned up the hood,
and kept the knife hidden but ready for any hazard.
Going down boldly he came out into the inner court,
crossed it and reached the gate without being challenged
by any of the men who loitered there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s heels were itching for a gallop, but he held
himself in hand, and walked on coolly, whistling through
his teeth. He was under the gateway, through it, and
crossing the bridge. Someone called to him, but he
laughed, crowed like a cock, and gave a wave of the hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The outer court with its great garden still lay before
him, and he followed the paved track, praying God to
keep all officious fools at a distance. Fifty paces, twenty
paces, ten paces, and he was at the outer gate, with the
cypresses black behind him, and no betrayal as yet.
The gate still stood open, though it was closed at sunset,
and to Aymery it was an arch of gold, a dark tunnel way
with a tympanum cut from the evening sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was half through it, when a lounger at the guard-room
door lurched forward and caught him roughly by
the cloak. It may have been a mere challenge to horse-play
or the grip of a swift suspicion. Aymery did not
wait to decide the matter, but struck the man across the
face with the knife, broke loose, and ran.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>They brought the Red Saint to Battle when the meadows
were a sheet of gold, and the thorn trees white above
the lush green grass. Dom Silvius and two of the Abbey
servants came for her in the morning, bringing a white
palfrey to carry her on the way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had kept vigil all that night, praying, and
striving to quiet a heart that would not be quieted.
And when the dawn had come she had gone out into
the garden and stood there silently, looking at the familiar
things that had mingled with her life. Yet very strange
had garden, hermitage, and woodland seemed to Denise
that morning; the strangeness of leave-taking was over
them, and the sadness of farewell. Even the rose trees
that had been given her, and which she had cherished,
had seemed to catch her memory, with their thorns.
Memories, memories! Some infinitely dear; others,
brutal and full of shame. The thatch would rot, the
walls crumble, the garden beckon back the wilderness.
And a great bitterness had fallen upon her, because of
what she was losing, and of what she had suffered, and
yet might suffer. She had felt glad in measure when she
had heard the tinkling bells on Dom Silvius’s bridle as
he had come riding through the beech wood. Her love
of the place had hurt her. The very stones had cried
out, and the pansies had scowled at her as she went down
the path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Battle there was joy that day, and a ringing of
bells, for Abbot Reginald had ordered it. And the song
of the bells went over the woodlands that gleamed or
grew gloomy as the clouds drifted. The cuckoo called;
green herbs rose to the knees; the meadows rippled with
gold; the oaks were in leaf. Over the blue hills, and
through slumbrous valleys filled with haze, Silvius and
Denise came to the Abbey lands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before her there, beside a wayside cross, Denise saw
many people gathered to welcome her, but her heart
wished them away. She would have come quietly to
this new refuge, nor had she foreshadowed Dom Silvius’s
pageantry. Here were gathered the Abbey singing boys
in white stoles, the precentor with them; also a number
of the Brethren, two and two, solemn figures with hoods
and hanging sleeves that seemed to catch the shadows.
All the townsfolk had streamed out from their boroughs,
old and young. Some carried green boughs, the girls
had their bosoms full of flowers, even toddling children
had their posies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s blood became as water in her when she saw
all these people gathered there, ready with their gaping
awe, and their inquisitive reverence. The bright colours
of their clothes, the greens, blues, and russets became a
blur before eyes that felt hot with bitter tears. It
was all so much mockery to Denise. The precentor’s
arms waved; the singing boys moved off two and two
to lead her, singing some quaint chant. The people
were down on their knees beside the road, all save the
girls who strewed their flowers before her. And Denise
rode by on her white palfrey, her eyes blind, her cheeks
burning, a strangle of humiliation in her throat, knowing
what these people could not know, and shamed to the
heart because of it. She saw neither the silent faces
under the row of cowls, nor the green boughs that waved,
nor the hands that were stretched out to her by children
and by women. Nor did she see Dom Silvius’s subtle
and happy face as he rode beside her, carrying a wooden
cross upon his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the white-stoled boys chanted, the bells rang
and the slow and sombre Brethren threaded their way
between the green boughs and the colours. The people
followed on, and began to buzz and to chatter. “The
Lady of Miracles has come to dwell with us,” they said.
Their mouths were full of all manner of marvels, and
each began to think of the advantage that might be
dreamed of.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She shall keep the sheep rot from us,” quoth
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And cure the bone ache and the rheumatics,” said
another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fat, pork butcher with a face the colour of swine’s
flesh remembered that his dame was to take to her bed
in a month, and that he would have her blessed
by Denise. A charm against “the staggers” was the
desire of a carrier. Wuluric, a wax chandler, wondered
whether his trade would be increased. One old
woman was eaten up with a sore that would not heal.
“I shall beg me a little of her spittle,” said she, “a
holy virgin’s spittle on a dock leaf is a wondrous
cure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they brought Denise to her cell near Mountjoye
Hill, and from that hour they began to call the little
field below it “Virgin’s Croft.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this had happened the day before Oswald and
Peter had told the Lord of the Saw-pit the tale of the
devil in the Goldspur beech wood. According to Grimbald’s
bidding they brought the pony to him at dawn,
helped him from his hiding-place, and set him upon the
beast which bore up bravely though Grimbald’s heels
nearly ploughed the ground. They started off through
the woods, thinking to make Goldspur within two hours,
but their reckonings were without the sanction of heaven,
for Grimbald’s pony stumbled over a red ant’s mound,
and threw the priest heavily, for he was weak after his
many days abed. And Grimbald lay on his back with
his arms spread out like the arms of a man crucified,
and Oswald and Peter stood and stared at him, and wondered
whether he was dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They knelt down and chafed his feet and hands until
Grimbald came to his senses again, and cheered them
with the uttering of a few godly curses. The men lifted
him up, and for their clumsiness he cursed them further,
and bade them put him with his back against a tree.
Grimbald, being a heavy man, had broken his right
collar-bone in the fall, and he was still weak for such
rough byplay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me a mouthful of water,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But neither Oswald nor Peter had water with them,
nor was there a pool near, nor a running brook. Grimbald
looked at them with mighty disdain, and Oswald,
sneaking off, mounted his pony to get what he could.
Five miles rode Oswald that morning before he came
to Burghersh village, and begged a hornful of mead
there, and a bottle of water. He bumped back again
at a rollicking canter, till his pony’s coat was as wet as
if he had swum a stream. Grimbald had been sick as
a dog with the twist of the fall, but the mead heartened
him, and he bade Oswald splash the water on his face.
Then they bound his right arm to his body with their
girdles, and when he had rested awhile, he made them
put him again upon the pony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was this mounting an easy matter, though
approached in subtle and backward fashion over the
pony’s tail. Happily the beast had no kick in him,
being tired and subdued. So they had Grimbald
astride, and started off once more, the men walking
one on either side, and steadying him as they
went.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What with the time wasted, and the slow travelling
that they made, evening was making the beech wood
brilliant as they climbed up out of the valley. The great
sentinel trees that stood forward from the main host
cast purple shadows upon the grass. A small herd of
red deer went trotting into the green-wood, and there
was a great silence save for the sucking patter of their
hoofs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One corner of Denise’s glade was still steeped in
sunlight when Grimbald and his men came from under
the beech trees. They could see that both the wicket
gate and the cell door stood open. Grimbald dismounted
at the wicket, and leaning on Oswald’s shoulder, went
up the path towards the cell. They were close to the
threshold when a brownish thing flew forth into
their faces, screamed, and sped away on noiseless
wings. It was only a great owl, but Oswald had
covered his face with his arm like one who fears a
blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly it was the devil, Father!” said
he, uncovering a pair of round and credulous
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald pushed on alone and entered the cell.
One glance showed him that it was empty. He saw
the rough bed with the coverlet spread awry, the
wooden settle, the hutch where Denise had kept her
clothes, the great water-jar in the corner. In the
cupboard he found nothing but a dry loaf, a drinking
horn, and the lamp that she had used. There
seemed no sign of violence, nor even of a hurried
flight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald stood there awhile considering, and then
went out into the gathering dusk. It seemed probable
to him that Denise had not been in the cell for some days,
for was not the bread dry and the water-jar empty? He
walked about the garden, turning his beak of a nose
this way and that like an eagle, his weakness and his
broken bone forgotten in the unravelling of this coil.
The little lodge built of faggots where Denise had kept
her tools and wood, enlightened him no further, and
he was ruffling his brows over it when he heard Oswald
calling. The man had caught all Grimbald’s spirit of
unrest, just as a dog catches the moods of his master,
and searching the ground he had found hoof marks on
the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald found him kneeling outside the wattle
fence, pointing at something that lay across a grass
tussock, something that glistened like a few shreds from
a woman’s hair. Oswald went on his hands and knees
with his face close to the turf. He beat to and fro awhile,
crawled forward across the glade, lay almost flat a moment,
and then started up with an eager cry. He had found
the fresh print of a horse’s hoofs in the grass under the
fringe of a tree whose boughs nearly touched the
ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald went to see what Oswald had to show
him. Dusk was falling fast, and they both stooped
low over the marks in the grass. But Oswald
started up on his haunches and sniffed the air like
a dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hist!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes dilated as he turned his head to and fro,
staring into the deepening gloom under the trees. Something
was moving out yonder. They heard one bough
strike another, a dead branch crack, the faint brushing
of feet through leaves and grass. Oswald laid a hand
on the knife at his belt; his teeth showed between
snarling lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Grimbald caught him by the shoulder, and they
turned back towards the cell where Peter loitered at
the wicket in the dusk, and the pony stood with tired
and drooping head. They were half across the glade
when a man came running after them, and they could
see that he was armed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald swung round instantly, and stood with head
thrown back, shoulders squared. A sword flashed not
three paces from him before his lion’s roar made the
dusk quiver. The man’s sword dropped, and he came
to a dead pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grimbald!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They caught each other as men do who love greatly,
and for a moment neither spoke. Then Aymery stood
back, and picked up his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise? Is she here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald’s forehead became seamed with lines.
His short silence betrayed perhaps more than he could
tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We came to find her, brother,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she is gone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cell is empty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s voice sounded harsh as the rasp of a saw.
He swung his sword up and let it rest upon his shoulder.
Even in the dusk Grimbald saw that glitter in the eyes,
that fierce closure of the lips, that spreading of the
nostrils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cell has been empty some days, I judge. I was
troubled for the sake of Denise, for I had heard
a strange tale from Oswald here. We came, and found
nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery swung to and fro with swift, sharp
strides. Then his sword shot out and pointed Oswald
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go. Out of earshot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man went. Aymery brought his sword back to
his shoulder, stretched out an arm, and showed Grimbald
something coiled about his wrist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look, a coil of her hair!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald bent his head, and then straightened with
a deep-drawn breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They put it under my door at Pevensey, the dogs!
Yesterday I broke out and hid in the marshes. They
gave chase, and I killed one of those who followed, and
took his horse and arms. That was to-day. Then I
galloped here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tossed his head, shaking back his hair, his eyes
hard as a frost. Then he pointed towards the hermitage
with his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is there in yonder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seemed to stiffen himself against the truth, challenging
Grimbald to tell him all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing, brother, but her bed, hutch and
cupboard and the like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more than that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery bent forward slightly, and looked into
Grimbald’s face. For a moment they stared each
other in the eyes as though asking and answering
silent questions. Then Aymery seemed to understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There has been some devil’s work here,”
he said, and Grimbald told him Oswald’s tale, and
showed where the hoof prints might be seen by
daylight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God knows the rest!” he said, smoothing his
beard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Aymery was kneeling, and praying to the cross
of his sword.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Twilight had fallen, a twilight of blue mists and vague,
mysterious distances. A young moon was in the sky, and
in a thicket near Denise’s cell nightingales were singing.
She was to offer herself at the high altar that night,
to strip her body before God, St. Martin, and Our Lady,
for Dom Silvius had so persuaded her, arguing that her
chaste holiness would be the more miraculous when
offered publicly to God. Denise had had no heart to
determine for herself, and to withstand Dom Silvius’s
arguments. Her womanhood stood mute and humbled,
feeling that some subtle virtue had fled out of her, and
left her without purpose. She had lost faith in her own
genius; in the magic crystal of her heart she could
no longer see visions. And like one very weary she
was leaving her destiny in the hands of others, letting
them think for her, and guide her as they pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the twilight had fallen Denise went out into
the little grass close before the cell, a close that was shut
in by a high thorn hedge. She carried with her a jar
of water that Abbot Reginald had blessed, a napkin,
a vial of perfumed oil, and a pure white shift and tunic,
given by the devout. No one could see her there, and
Denise stripped off her old clothes, washed her body
from head to foot, dried it, and anointed it with oil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the warmth of her bosom made the perfume
of the oil rise up into her nostrils, and the perfume seemed
to steal straight into Denise’s heart. The night was
very still, save for the song of the nightingales. Dew
had fallen on the grass, yet a sweet warmth rose out of
the earth, a warmth that is rare in the month of May.
There was the moon yonder, and far hills faint under a
mysterious sky. And Denise who a moment ago had
felt miserable and weary of soul, in one breath was blushing
as red as a rose, her whole body quivering in the moonlight,
her eyes full of some inward fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A call from the unknown had come to her, and her
heart had answered it, and for the moment she stood
transfigured. The night seemed magical, a-whisper with
mystery. She felt that she must steal away into the
sweet green gloom of the woods, taking all hazards,
dreaming a great love. She stretched her arms above
her head, so their white and anointed sheen caught
the faint light of the moon. Then as a white flame leaps
and falls again into the darkness, so Denise’s arms fell
suddenly across her bosom. The warmth and the
perfume had gone again, and she felt cold in body and
in heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What could it avail her that she was a woman and
could dream dreams? The torch was quenched, the
wine spilt from the jar. There was no other path than
this even though it was strewn with thorns. She must
follow it to the end, forgetting that other life, and yet
remembering it, hating the world, yet thinking of one
heart that might have stood for the whole world. If
she escaped bitterness and shame, surely she should
be grateful, and contented with such mercies. There
was no other life for her but this one of self-renunciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly, and very sadly she put on the white shift
and tunic, emblems of what the world believed in. She
bound up her hair and the touch of it brought back the
memory of that night, a memory that stung like an asp
at the breast. When she had dressed herself, she knelt
on the threshold to pray until the midnight offering.
But her misery fled forth into other ways, and she thought
of man before she thought of God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hours had passed, and there was a sense of stir somewhere
over yonder where the abbey lay. A bell began
to toll, slowly and sonorously, the first clang of its clapper
sounding a note of dismal sanctity. Torches were being
lit, for a faint glare began to rise above the orchards
and the thickets, and Denise, kneeling on the bare stones,
knew that the hour of her renunciation was near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of their coming was still a sound in the
distance when Denise heard the trampling of a horse
along the road that ran not very far from her cell. It
ceased suddenly, and a murmur of voices came up to her
in the darkness. Then all was still again save for the
tolling of the bell, and the solemn chanting which told her
that Dom Silvius and the Brethren who had charge of her
were coming with torches over the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Denise had risen and gone out into the green
close when the trampling of hoofs came along the thorn
hedge with the creaking of harness, and the snorting of a
horse. Denise stood still, holding her breath as she
listened. The moon had gone, and the only light was
the glare of the torches that were topping the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise heard a voice calling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise,” it said; “Sancta Denise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trampling of hoofs had ceased, and there was
silence save for the chanting of the monks upon the hill
top. Something moved beyond the hedge, and Denise
heard the latch of the gate lifted. The heart stood still
in her a moment. Someone was near her in the close,
for she heard the sound of breathing, and the rustling
of feet in the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man’s whisper came to her out of the dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment, she knew not how, the warm silence
of the night grew full of love and life. He was close to
her with a white, passionate face looking into hers, questioning
her very soul. Perhaps their hands touched.
It was like the tumult and yearning of waters in a dark
and narrow place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was trembling from head to foot. Aymery
had touched her hand, no more than that, yet nothing
but a thin film of darkness seemed to hold the two apart.
Denise heard the outpouring of his words, a man’s words,
poignant and tender, striking her very heart. What could
she say to him, with this renunciation of hers so near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise, why have you left us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She covered her face with her arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, lord, was it not you who told me to seek a
surer refuge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hands were straining back, and straining forward,
as though to touch her, and not to touch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but that was a while ago. Things happen in
this world, when a man is tied to his bed. If all has been
well with you——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let her arms fall from before her face, and there,
above them, the dark hillside was seamed with a stream
of light. And in the flare of the torches she could see
many shadowy figures moving, and the outline of a great
cross carried in the van.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery had seemed blind to all save the white figure
before him. But the torch flare struck across his face,
and he seemed suddenly to understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Denise spoke, as though compelling herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are coming for me,” she said. “To-night,
I offer myself at the high altar. They must not find
you here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not answer her for the moment, but stood
looking at the torches, almost stupidly, like a man
stunned. Then he bowed his head before her, spoke her
name, and went out into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery remembered all that followed as a man
remembers few things in the course of his life. He hid
his horse in a thicket, and followed on foot when the cross
and the torches turned back towards the abbey. The
abbey town seemed full of strange curious faces, of
shadowy figures that jostled him, of the light of torches,
of folk whispering together. There were many people
moving under the gate, and on towards the abbey church.
Aymery moved with them, silently, dully, like one carried
along in the midst of a stream. They flowed in at the
doors, these people, and on between pillars that towered
up into darkness, and along aisles that were shadowy
and dim. The high altar alone was lit with many waxen
candles. The Brethren were in their stalls, the sound of
chanting came from somewhere out of the dusk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then began in that great church the last episode of
Dom Silvius’s pageant. Aymery, leaning against a pillar
in the darkness, saw Denise kneeling before the altar,
Reginald of Brecon near her, and two of the most aged
of the monks. A bell rang; a strong and strident voice
spoke some prayer; then the chanting soared and rolled
into the far vaultings of the roof. Heads were bowed
everywhere; the monks in the choir had their faces
hidden. But Aymery’s eyes were turned towards the
altar where the candles flickered and the smoke of incense
seemed to curl and ascend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw Denise rise, drop her white tunic and shift,
and kneel naked upon the altar steps. An old monk
bent over her, and clipped away her hair so that it fell
like light about her body. She bent before the altar
with outstretched arms, and holy water was sprinkled
upon her body and her clothes. A voice sounded. She
rose slowly and re-arrayed herself. One long murmur
seemed to pass like a wind through the darkened church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The year of a novitiate had begun, a season of
probation that should pass before more solemn and
final vows should be put upon her. Silvius, shrewd
man, had advised Denise guardedly for the sake of the
honour of his “house.” There should be a ceremony,
a kneeling before the altar. That would please the
people, and bring her more solemnly before their eyes.
Then let Denise prove herself as a child of miracles,
and they could talk of the greater and more lasting
vows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the aisles seemed alive with swirling water.
The people were moving forth with lowered heads, while
Denise knelt again before the high altar with its candles.
Aymery went with the people, looking back but once
when he had reached the western door. The night
struck warm after the cold air of the great church. He
found himself in the abbey town, walking aimlessly in
the midst of many moving, whispering figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a great hunger to be alone seized him. He
almost ran through the straggling town, up past Mountjoye
to where he had hidden his horse. And when the
first grey of the dawn came he was galloping northwards
along the forest roads as though trying to distance the
memories of the past night.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>At Pevensey that June-tide Peter of Savoy discovered
something that concerned him, thanks to Gaillard’s
foolhardiness, and the Gascon’s boastful, passionate
nature. There were bitter words between the Lady of
the Lute, and Peter of Savoy, though much of the bitterness
was in Etoile’s mouth, for the Count could be cold
as a frost, when cheated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” said he, looking her coolly in the face,
“it is every man’s privilege to see that he is not fooled.
Let us be merciful to one another. You will find a horse
at the gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Etoile might have persuaded most men with
her beauty, but in my Lord Peter’s eyes there was a
look that told her that he would use steel if she
made a mocking of his pride. She smothered her
words, and dissembled her wrath before him, for he
was too cold and clever a man to be treated as
she would have treated Gaillard. “Go,” his eyes
said to her, “and be thankful in the going.” And
Etoile hid her rage, and went, half wondering the
while whether some man had orders to stab her in
the back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Peter of Savoy sent for Messire Gaillard, but
the Gascon had become suddenly discreet, and betaken
himself early to the stable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His master snapped his fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let the fool go,” he said. “Madame will need
company on the road to the devil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of his gentlemen, a very young man, showed
some concern for the Lady of the Peacocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you turn her out next to naked, sire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter of Savoy laughed in his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you a fool, also, Raymond? Go with her if
it pleases you, you will have to fight the Gascon. God
knows, I would prevent no man drinking green wine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they turned Etoile out of Pevensey, suffering her
to take nothing with her but the horse, the clothes she
rode in, a little money, and such jewels as were hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peter of Savoy had not judged the case amiss, for if
Raymond of the Easy Heart had followed Dame Etoile
some miles that morning, he would have found Gaillard
waiting for her under the shade of a beech wood near
the road. But at first Etoile would not look at the man,
for her anger was still hot in her because of all that had
passed. She reviled Gaillard without mercy, letting
the whip of her tongue flay him as he rode along beside
her horse, half loving her and half hating her for her
taunts and for her fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether Gaillard spoke up well for himself, or whether
Etoile began to consider her necessity, it came about
that she gave up mocking him, and let him ride more
peaceably beside her. Probably it was not what Gaillard
said, but what Etoile thought that brought them to
softer speaking. The woman looked at once to the
future, and the future to her was a forecasting of the
importunities of self. Here was she, worse off in pride
than any beggar woman, she whom Peter of Savoy had
brought with pomp and homage out of the South.
Gaillard had brought all this upon her, and Gaillard
seemed her necessity since she was set adrift in a strange
land. Perhaps she loved him a very little, with the
treacherous, transient love of a leopardess. For the
present he must serve her. The husk of to-day might
be the gold shoe of the morrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matters were so well mended between them that they
halted to rest under the shade of a tree. And there
Gaillard knelt in his foolish, passionate way, and swore
many oaths on the cross of his sword. Etoile curled
her lip at him, and bade him save his breath. She was
in no mood for such philanderings, and had other thoughts
in her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Messire Gaillard,” said she, “you and I must
understand each other if we are to travel the road together.
Those who are turned out of doors must learn
to face rough weather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard showed his temper by pulling out a purse,
and pouring the gold in it at her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such stuff is to be won. I will fight to win pay
for you, my desire, as never man fought before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etoile touched the money contemptuously with her
foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put it back again, you may need it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard shrugged, and humoured her. He spun one
of the coins, caught it, and balanced it on his thumb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A woman is made a wife for less,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And kept, for less. Listen, fool, we are not a girl
and a boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke to Gaillard a long while, looking in his eyes
as she spoke. At first Gaillard carried his head sulkily,
but little pleased with what she said. Presently his
eyes began to glitter, he protruded his chin, and once
more his shoulders seemed ready to swagger. Before
Etoile had ended she had made him her man, ready to
skip to the tune she piped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendour of God!” and he began to laugh.
“That is a game after my own heart. In a year the
King shall give us the best of his castles. What Fulk
de Brauté did, I can do even better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sprang up, happy, vain, and audacious, not thinking
to read into the deeps of Etoile’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a great man, my Gaillard,” she said. “You
and I shall make our fortunes without waiting for Peter’s
pence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardly three leagues away from these two worldlings
the Church took cognizance of holier things, and sought
to boast of a miracle at the hands of Denise. More than
a month had passed since the Lady of Healing, as the
folk called her, had knelt at midnight before the altar,
and offered her body to the glory of God. Dom Silvius,
dreaming his dreams, and chaffering over his ambitions,
thought the time ripe for Denise to prove her sanctity.
For a month she had been left in solitude to commune
with the saints, save that an Abbey servant had daily
brought her food and drink. The thoughts of all the
people turned to the thorn hedge and the brown thatched
cell that stood on the northern slope of Mountjoye Hill;
and human nature being self-seeking, especially in its
prayers, each soul had some hope of profiting by the
miraculous hands of Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Etoile and Gaillard rode together in the course
of adventure, Dom Silvius came to Virgin’s Croft, and a
servant with him bearing a young child in his arms.
Several women followed devoutly at the almoner’s heels,
keeping their distance because of Dom Silvius’s carefulness
towards the sex. The child was said to be possessed by
a devil, and when a fit took him he would fall down
foaming, struggle awhile, and then lie like one dead.
The devil had brought him to such a pass, that he seemed
frailer and feebler after each seizure. The boy was the
only son of his mother, the brawny wife of a still more
brawny smith, and they had great hopes for the child
now that Denise had come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius had the child laid before her door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A devil teareth him, Sister,” said he. “Your
purity shall drive the devil out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they left the child with her, and went their
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Denise was very miserable that day because of
something in herself that she had begun to fear, and she
needed her own heart healing before she might dream of
healing others. The world remained with her, though
she was shut up as a saint, and the solitude and the
loneliness had preyed the more upon her mind. At Goldspur
the wild woodland life and the life of the people
had been hers. Here she had only her own haunting
thoughts, and a voice that whispered that the virtue
had gone out of her, and that she no longer had the
power to help and to heal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with a kind of anguish that she watched over
the child, taking him to her bed, and praying that the
devil of epilepsy might go forth. All that day she watched
and prayed, the boy lying in a stupor with wide eyes
and open mouth. So the night came, and Denise lit
her taper, and knelt down again beside the child. All
that night she pleaded and strove with God, beseeching
Him to show His grace to her for her own sake and the
child’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just before dawn the boy was taken with a strong
seizure, crying out at first, and then lying stiff and straight
and silent as a stone image. Denise took him into her
lap, put her mouth to his mouth, and held him against
her bosom. As the dawn came, so the truth dawned
also that the boy was dead, dead in her lap despite her
prayers. And a great horror came upon her, as though
God had deserted her, nor had the saints listened to her
prayers. A new shame chilled her heart. The virtue
had gone out of her, she felt alone with her own thoughts,
and the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Dom Silvius and the women came some two
hours after dawn they found Denise seated upon the
bed with the dead child in her lap. A kind of stupor
seemed upon her. She did not so much as move, but
sat there with vacant face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is dead. Take him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was all she said to Dom Silvius. The almoner
took the boy, not able to hide the mortification on his
face as he carried the dead child to his mother. Denise
heard the woman’s cry, though the cry seemed far away
like a voice in a dream. Dom Silvius sought to comfort
her, but comfort her he could not, because she had hoped
so much from Denise’s prayers. And as is the way so
often with the human heart, the woman went home in
bitterness and anger, holding the dead child to her breast,
and murmuring against Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Denise felt herself deserted of God, there was one
Sussex man who did not lack for inspiration, and
whose heart was possessed by both God and the devil.
Aymery of Goldspur had ridden from the Thames to the
Severn, to join Earl Simon’s army that was on the march
from the Welsh borders. The great Earl was like a rock
in a troubled sea, or a beacon that drew all those who
loved their land, and who strove for better things. The
King might call him a “turbulent schemer”; sneers
never killed a man like De Montfort. For the heart of
England was full of turbulence, and it seemed that
England’s heart beat in Earl Simon’s breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery, wild as a hawk, borne along by the storm-wind
of his restless manhood, grieving, exulting, torn by
a great tenderness that could have no hope, came within
the ken of the People’s Earl. For it was Aymery’s
need that month to throw himself at the gallop into
some cause, to live in the midst of tumult, to let his face
burn wherever the banners blew. Perhaps fortune set
her seal on him because he was ready to hazard his life
with the fierce carelessness of a man who had no traffic
with the future. Be that as it may, Simon’s host marched
down from the West, taking Hereford and Gloucester
on its way, and Aymery had caught the great Earl’s
eye before they came to Reading Town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, on the march from Reading to Guildford,
over the heathlands and wild wastes, there were skirmishes
with the King’s men who had pushed out from Windsor.
Sharp tussles these, horsemen galloping each other down,
spear breaking on the hillsides, men slain on the purple
heather. Here the fiercer, bolder spirits were to be found,
the young eagles who would redden their talons. In one
such skirmish Aymery charged in, and rescued young
John de Montfort who had been taken prisoner through
too much zeal and daring. At Reigate again there was
more fighting, though the place soon fell, yet Fortune
pushed Aymery into a lucky chance. Certain of the
King’s men, hired ruffians most of them, had barricaded
themselves in a church, nor would they budge, though an
assault was given under the eyes of the Earl himself.
Fortune helped Aymery as she so often helps the man
who is careless as to his own end. He found the window
of a side chapel unguarded, broke in, and held his ground
desperately till others followed, and the place was won.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Earl Simon himself came into the church, and knelt
there before the altar, close to where two of the King’s
men lay dead in their blood. When he had finished his
prayer, he stood on the altar steps and called for the
man who had leaped down first into the church. And
they put Aymery forward, finding him standing behind
a pillar, and so gave him the glory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simon made ready to knight him there in the church,
but Aymery begged seven days to chasten himself, keep
vigils, and be blessed with his sword and shield. Simon
looked at him steadily, for he was a man after his own
heart, grim, resourceful, dangerously quiet, and no
boaster. He granted Aymery the seven days, telling
him to come to Tonbridge whither the host went towards
the siege of Dover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God first, man afterwards,” he said. “You have
chosen as I would have you choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Aymery slept that night at Guildford before the
altar of the church. When the dawn came he mounted
his horse, and rode southwards, alone.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A man’s chivalry must have a queen to crown it with
the crown of a high purpose, and Aymery had no will
to forget Denise, nor the mystical beauty of her womanhood.
The thought of her drew him as the Holy City
drew those who had taken the cross. Since he was to
be made a knight, she should bless his arms for him, and
serve as a Lady who looked at him out of Heaven. Thus
Aymery went riding southwards in the July heat, saying
his prayers devoutly at dawn and at sunset, bathing his
body when he found clear water; and filling his soul
with the thought of Denise. He had broken himself
to the belief that she was lost to the world, though he
was still troubled as to the happenings that had driven
her from Goldspur. Denise’s silence seemed sacred to
him, and her unapproachableness made his love the
greater. Now, like a man who has found a good
excuse, he returned again to win a glimpse of her
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Late on the afternoon of the first day Aymery turned
aside from the road under the shade of an oak tree to
rest his horse. Below him stretched a deep valley with
the road running through it like a white thread; the place
seemed very desolate, while on the farther side of the
valley the woods came down close to the road. The day
was full of a shimmer of gold, and no mowers had come
to mow the summer grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Aymery sat there under the shade of the tree, he
saw a man in a blue surcoat riding a grey horse along the
road below. Aymery had hardly set eyes on him when
he saw the man halt, and remain motionless under the
July sun that glittered on him and showed that he was
armed. A woman had come out from the woods close
to the road, a woman with black hair and a scarlet tunic
that shone up against the green. What was passing
between them Aymery could not tell, but he saw the
woman disappear into the woods and the man on the grey
horse follow her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some time had passed, and Aymery’s thoughts had
flown elsewhere, when a cry rose out of the summer
silence, held a moment, and then died down. Presently
he saw a grey horse and a rider in blue reappear out
of the woods with another horse and rider beside him.
The second man wore green, and carried a plain, black
shield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery saw them ride away westwards into the
golden light that covered the woods and the valley.
The way they rode seemed strange to him, for the horses
went shoulder to shoulder, and one arm of the man in
green lay about the body of the rider in blue. He was
puzzled moreover by the thought of the woman in
the red tunic, and the cry that he had heard, and
it crossed his mind that there had been foul play
yonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had mounted and come down to the place
where the blue knight had turned aside, Aymery turned
aside also into the woods. A little way in, under the
trees where a bank rose covered with bracken, he found
a track that had been trampled leading to a place where
someone seemed to have lain. But he saw nothing else
beyond the tree boles, the cool green foliage, and the
bracken splashed here and there with sunlight.
When he called, no voice answered him, so he rode
out of the wood and went his way. Yet there was
more in the wood than he had seen, nor did he
guess that he would meet again with the rider on the
grey horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the evening of the second day Aymery came to
the hills by Montifeld, and saw the Senlac uplands
smitten by the evening light. Beyond Watlingtun he
found a man mowing grass beside the road, and stopped
to question him concerning Denise. The man pointed
towards Mountjoye Hill, for they could see from where
they stood the thatched roof of the cell above the thorn
hedge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Virgin’s cell is yonder, lording,” he said,
thinking perhaps that Aymery rode thither to be cured
of some wound, and that he would be disappointed, for
the Lady of Healing had worked no cures since they had
brought her to the Abbey lands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was at her prayers, kneeling on the threshold
with the door of the cell wide open, when she heard the
trampling of Aymery’s horse, a sound from the outer
world that made her heart stand still and listen. There
was a minute’s silence before she heard the latch of the
gate lifted, and someone moving through the unmown
grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aymery! Lord!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw the wave of colour go over her face, for he
had come upon her suddenly as she knelt there upon the
threshold. The rush of blood from the heart died down
again. She looked at him, and prayed that he should
not see that she was trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise rose up from her knees as though the sound
of her own voice had broken some spell. A kind of dumb
discomfiture possessed them both. Aymery, with the
sunlight shining on his battle harness, felt challenged
by his own silence. The words he had meant to utter
stuck in his throat, for that wave of redness over the
woman’s face had somehow made him feel ungenerous
and a coward. What right had he to come galloping
into her life again, when they had put a day of dreams
behind them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And like a man who would be honest, he stumbled
to the blunt perfunctoriness of a boy going down on his
knees in a church. There was something to be gone
through with, and the sooner the better, since he had
begun so clumsily. Many women would have misunderstood
the mood in him. Denise understood it, perhaps
more clearly than Aymery himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes questioned him, more than her voice.
Aymery put his shield before him as he knelt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been with Earl Simon,” he said, looking at
his shield. “It is to be the sword on the shoulder, and
a pair of spurs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke, with a slight shrug of the shoulders, a man
ill at ease under his own eyes, even though self-consciousness
was not part of his normal nature. Denise’s
heart had dropped to a steadier rhythm. The quicker
wit of the woman has always the advantage of the
man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Earl Simon gave me some days, to keep vigils,
wash, and be cleansed. I would have my arms blessed
also, they will serve in a good cause.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew out his sword, set it point downwards in
the grass, and looked at it, and not at Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had her two hands over her bosom, and
seemed to draw several breaths before she could
speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is the Abbot Reginald.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Should I ride forty miles to be blessed by Reginald
of Brecon? Here are my sword and shield. Bless them,
or they shall go unblessed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him, recoiling upon the consciousness
of all that had happened to her since the days at Goldspur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can bless them, Denise. Who better?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fog in the air between them thinned and vanished.
But neither Aymery nor Denise noticed its passing.
Life, and the infinite earnestness thereof had both their
hearts in thrall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it so great a thing to ask, Denise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was looking at her steadily now, the self-consciousness
had slipped from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, if my blessing were but worthy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Need you ask that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is I who ask it of my own heart,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flung out his arms suddenly, and his face blazed
up at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For England, for the land, not for me alone, Denise.
Mother of God—I will have no other. Am I not wise as
to my own desire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His ardour caught her spirit and sent it soaring above
the earth as a wind blows a half-dead beacon into flame.
The miserable self-fear, the consciousness of coming
shame fell away from her like a ragged garment. She
was the Denise of the woods again, with miraculous eyes
and hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give them to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stretched out her arms, took his shield, held it
to her bosom, and spoke words over it that Aymery
could not hear. Yet how much love and how much
supplication there were in those words of hers, the
heart of a woman alone could tell. She took his
sword also, kissed the cross thereof, and held it on
high.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Break not, fail not. Keep troth, rust never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him the sword again, and Aymery kissed
it, and knelt awhile with bowed head, as though in prayer.
Then he rose up out of the grass, holding the cross of the
sword before his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would keep my vigil here,” he said. “Yonder
where there is a thicket of young oaks. Before dawn,
I shall be gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s face was still transfigured. The realisation
of her earthliness had not returned as yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God guard you in the wars,” she said to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery lifted his head, and for a moment they
looked into each other’s eyes. Then he turned from
her as though his own heart bade him go. And it seemed
to each that they had snatched a moment of joy from
that half-closed hand of life that holds more pain than
gladness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were some children standing staring at his
horse when Aymery came out from the wicket in the
hedge of thorns. He paid no heed to them however, and
taking his horse by the bridle, led him to the oak thicket
on the hillside below Virgin’s Croft. The children ran
away into the town, and told their mothers that they
had seen a knight come out of St. Denise’s gate with a
naked sword over his shoulder. The children’s tale-bearing
caused some tattle in the Abbey town, and the
Abbey servants heard it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus these two, soldier and saint, passed the night
within call of one another; Aymery kneeling bareheaded
under the stars, with sword and shield before
him; Denise pitiably wakeful in her cell, conscious of
the darkness, and of that shadow of darkness that grew
each day more heavy about her heart. She prayed for
Aymery that night, prayed for herself, and against the
future that she dreaded. They were so near to each
other, and yet so utterly apart. It seemed to Denise
that night that she had fled to this place of refuge, only
to meet the greater bitterness and shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last the dawn came, and with it the sound of a horse
moving over the grass. She heard Aymery come riding
up to the hedge of thorns. She saw his sword flash out
against the dawn as he stood in the stirrups and called
her name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise, Denise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God keep you,” she answered him in her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went away into the world at a gallop, as though
it was easier to leave her thus in the gold and green of a
summer morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery had been gone but half an hour when a monk
and two lay brethren came hurrying over Mountjoye
Hill. Their figures looked dark, intent, outlined against
the virginal clearness of the dawn. The monk was Dom
Silvius, and his eyes were sharp and watchful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came alone to Denise’s cell, leaving the two lay
brothers at the gate in the hedge. Denise was washing
her neck and bosom; she had closed the door, and
suffered Silvius to speak to her from without. She soon
learnt that he had heard of Aymery’s coming, and that he
desired to discover the reason thereof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was one who rode here, Father, to have his arms
blessed. He is on the eve of knighthood, and kept his
vigil in the wood, yonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius’s face was very astute, he stroked his chin
and considered. There was nothing of the dreamer about
him that morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the offering, Sister, the offering?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise did not choose to understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What offering, Father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That which the man left, for the blessing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He left no offering with me,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No gift, Sister, nothing out of gratitude for the
blessing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not even a ring or a piece of money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius’s face condemned such vagrant meanness. He
hid his vexation, and spoke softly, remembering that he
was dealing with a certain sensitive thing called
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister,” said he. “Perhaps the man was poor. We
grudge nothing to those who are blessed with poverty.
But an offering should always be made, even though it
be but the half of an apple. God loves not niggardliness,
my sister, and I would not have our good Lord, St.
Martin, offended.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise could not see Silvius because of the closed door,
but there was something in his voice that made her see
him as a sharp-faced, shrewd, insinuating figure hiding
covetousness under the cloak of humility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I asked for nothing, Father,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius’s face was very cunning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, my Sister, we do not barter with our own
souls. But there are the poor to be remembered, the
fabric of the church, the glory of St. Martin. There is
no shame in holding out the hand for these.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s hands were fastening her tunic. And in
the darkness of the cell she seemed to understand suddenly,
as one comes by the understanding of the deeper things
of life in the midst of some great sorrow, the reason of
their eagerness to win her to the Abbey. The realisation
of it was like the discovery of simony and self-seeking in
the character of one beloved. She stood motionless,
staring at the door beyond which Silvius listened. And
the day seemed bitter and sordid to her after the night
of Aymery’s vigil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such things as I receive,” she said, “shall be
laid before the altar,” and from that moment she felt
that she hated Silvius because she had seen the motives
that moved his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is well, Sister,” he answered her. “St. Martin
is generous to all who give.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The almoner went away grumbling to himself, disgusted
as any Jew that a man who had benefited should
have left nothing in return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The woman needs more shrewdness,” he thought.
“Nor have we had any marvel from her yet to open the
people’s hearts, and purses. God grant that we have not
made an indifferent bargain. We are losing rental, and
giving food and gear,” and he returned in a temper,
and thought mercenary thoughts all through Matins
in the Abbey Church. For to Silvius his “house”
was a great treasure-chest to be guarded, and enriched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was glad when Silvius had gone, and though
she strove to put the sneering suspicions from her, they
remained like dead trees, white and ugly in the green of a
living wood. To count the money in the alms-box, to
clutch at the offering, with the prayer hardly gone from
the mouth! It was not in her soul to suffer such a
traffic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day seemed very grey to her, though the sun was
shining, because of that other thing that haunted her
more than the thought of Dom Silvius’s keenness. She
felt more and more that the virtue had gone out of her,
and that the Lord of the Abbey would have no miracles
to bring him treasure. If this thing were to mature,
what then would follow? She shut the eyes of her soul
to it, and tried to think of that night in May as but the
memory of an evil dream.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>From the gold of the wheat harvest to the picking of
red apples no great time passes, yet in those few weeks
the people began to scoff openly at the healing powers
of Denise. She had been brought in with such quaint
pomp and ceremony, with such singing, and such a show
of blossom on the boughs, that folk had looked for a
wonderful fruiting, and for an especial blessedness that
should show itself in each man’s house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise, poor wench, had come into the wilds of life,
to find primitive things dragging her beautiful altruism
into ruins. She had lost her wings and could no longer
soar, because of the earthliness that grew more apparent
to her day by day. Everything that she attempted
failed with her, and faith in her own power dwindled
out of her heart. Long ago she had noticed the prophetic
change in Dom Silvius’s attitude. He was suspicious,
grieved, hesitatory, always hoping for some lucky miracle,
some splendid coincidence that might fire the beacon of
his imaginings. He had boasted a little of this Virgin
Saint out of the woods, and the eyes of some of the
Brethren were beginning to twinkle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One sunny day early in October Dom Silvius went
down to the stews to fish. There happened to be some
of the younger monks there, and Guimar the hosteler,
a long, lean quiz of a man whom Silvius hated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother,” said he to the almoner. “Have you
come to fish?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dom Silvius answered the question by settling his
stool with great deliberation at the edge of the pond.
Guimar glanced at the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My Brothers,” he said. “See, here is Silvius come
a-fishing. Let us kneel and pray for him, and perchance
his saint may catch a miracle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all laughed at the joke, all save Silvius, who bit
his lips. And from that moment his pride began to
work like a slow poison in him, filling him with a hatred
of Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once only, and that in August, Father Grimbald
had come stalking up the hill to Virgin’s Croft, when the
people were busy with the harvest, and there were none
to see his coming. What he said to Denise, and she
to him, no man knew, for Grimbald held his peace concerning
it. But Denise wept when he had gone, bitter,
impassioned tears that welled up out of her heart. Grimbald’s
brow was heavy with a thunder cloud of thought
as he trudged home to Goldspur over the hills. He
opened and closed his great fists as he went, as though
yearning to smite something, or to take an enemy by
the throat. He had been unable to learn much from
Denise, save that she seemed unhappy, and that she had
left Goldspur because of the violence of the times. Grimbald
had his own suspicions, but speak them he could not,
though he was troubled within himself for Denise’s
sake. He knew that it had not been a matter of vainglory
with her, a desire to be flattered by the worship of a
wider world. Oswald’s tale of the Devil on the Black
Horse loomed largely in the background of Grimbald’s
mind. Denise had hidden something from him. Of
that Grimbald felt assured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The burgher folk of Battle and the people on the
Abbey lands began to have their grievances against
Denise, grumbling with superstitious pettiness because
their hopes had profited so little. There was a multitude
of small things remembered against her, for of what use
was a holy woman if her sanctity brought no blessings.
Grubs had attacked the apples; why had not Denise
prevented that? The sheep had been worried with
the “fly”; again Denise had been besought to pray
against the pest. Many of the wells had run dry with
the hot summer; what was the use of a saint who could
not bring back water?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were many more things quoted against her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mulgar the carrier had brought a horse cursed with
“wind sucking” and the staggers. A holy woman should
be able to conjure such trifles, and Mulgar had brought
three pennies as an offering. The horse had died on
the road next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gilbert the miller was plagued with rats. And the
rats prospered, even though he had brought a dead
buck rat to Denise, and besought her to curse the vermin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Olivia, the goldsmith’s wife, brought a girl with a
purple birth-mark on her cheek. She desired Denise to
touch the stain that it might disappear. The birth-mark
remained for all to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A woman in child-bed sent for Denise’s blessing.
The child was still-born the very same night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well might Denise feel that the virtue had gone out
of her, that the people were beginning to mock, and that
her prayers were as so much chaff. The bitterness and
the humiliation were not of her own seeking. They
had set her upon a pinnacle, crowded about her open-mouthed,
ready for the blessings she should bestow.
Her white garments, and her burning aureole of hair
had dazzled them, and the power of her beauty remained
with her still. But the mystery was passing; she had
profited none of the people; her prayers had burst like
bubbles in the air. And since the human heart is ever
a fickle thing, ready to scoff and sneer, and think itself
cheated when its own fancies fall to the ground, the
very children began to catch the spirit of their elders,
and to throw surreptitious stones at Denise’s door.
They invented a game, too, that they called the Silly
Saint, in which one of the girls wore a halo of straw and
attempted to work wonders which were never wonderful,
till the audience rose and rolled her in the grass. No
one chided them for such indecent blasphemy. Even
Dom Silvius was ready to wash his hands of Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were more sinister whisperings in the air as
the autumn drew on and merged into the winter. Bridget,
the smith’s wife, whose boy had died on Denise’s knees,
had set her tongue and her spite against the saint. The
woman had been very bitter against Denise all through
the summer, laughing maliciously over her failures,
and nodding her head with the air of “I could have told
you so.” When neighbours had still seemed credulous,
she had put her tongue in her cheek, and mocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bridget and some other women were spreading their
linen on the grass one windy October day, and their
talk turned upon Denise. As women will, they spoke
of the things that had been noised abroad of late. There
were some that said that Denise was no saint, that she
was no better than they themselves were, far worse in
fact because of her vows. It had been told that a strange
knight had kept a vigil near her cell, and the women
laughed, as only women of a kind can.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bridget, the smith’s wife, was the bitterest of them
all, because of her dead child, and the spite that she
had nurtured against Denise. And as they spread their
linen on the grass she began to tease the women, and to
tantalise them with all manner of cryptic nods, and
sneers, and insinuations. The end of it all was that
much of the linen blew hither and thither because the
women were so eager to listen to Bridget, and forgot
to weigh the sheets and body gear down with stones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bridget was the fat hen with the worm in her beak,
and they all crowded about her as though to thieve it.
But all she did was to laugh and to smooth her frock
with her two hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The women set up a great cackling, and then ran to
and fro to catch the linen that was blowing in the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blessed Martin,” said one, “when the Abbot hears
of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A mighty poor miracle for Dom Silvius to boast
of! I could do as well myself.”</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The early days of December found Earl Simon lodged at
Southwark, while the King and his men prowled to and
fro in Kent, coveting England’s sea gate, Dover, that
the barons had taken in the summer. Earl Simon had
no great gathering with him in Southwark, for he had
London at his back, an ant’s nest into which the King
would not venture to thrust his spear. There had been
much bloodshed and violence in the land, and it was
De Montfort’s hope that Henry would show some wisdom
now that he had seen many of his great lords in arms
against him. A truce had been mooted, with Louis of
France to judge between the two parties. Yet no man
trusted Henry, because of his fickleness and his
foolish cunning, and because of the favourites who had
his ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry had hated the Londoners with exceeding
bitterness since they had pelted his Queen from London
Bridge when she had sought to escape to Windsor in
the summer. They had thrown stones and offal at her
barge, and the King, and Edward his son, talked of the
blood of the city as though it were the blood of swine.
It was even said that they had sworn upon relics to make
a slaughter there that should be remembered for many
years. Yet a number of the wealthier merchants were
for the King, partly because they hated the lesser men
and the mob, and partly because they had taken bribes.
There was treachery afoot of which Earl Simon knew
nothing, nor had he any foreshadowings of the peril
that was near.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in December Henry had attempted to win
his way into Dover. The attempt had failed miserably;
and the news was that he and his men were still lingering
on the coast. No one thought of him as within ten leagues
of London; the traitors in the city were alone wise as
to his plans. Earl Simon remained in Southwark,
debating the future with the barons who were with him,
and with the Londoners who would hear of nothing but
that the King should swallow the Great Charter, and
that the Provisions of Oxford should hold. They had
not forgotten Richard of Cornwall’s corn ships, and
the way Henry had attempted to play the Jew at the
expense of the starving poor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It so happened that Aymery was in the saddle one
December evening as the darkness came down over the
land like a rolling fog. Rain had begun to fall, a fine
drizzle that made the fading horizon in the west a dim
grey streak. Infinite mournfulness breathed in the gust
of a wet winter wind. Tired horses plodded past
Aymery as he sat motionless by the roadside, the
hood of his cloak turned over his helmet. A party
had been out to bring in forage, and Aymery had
had the handling of the escort, a few archers and
men-at-arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last tired horse had gone splashing by, and the
creaking of the saddles and the breathing of the beasts
were dropping into the darkness before Aymery turned
to follow his men. He was about to push his horse to
a trot when he heard the sound of a man running along
the wet, wind-swept road. Aymery drew up across the
road, and saw a figure come out of the darkness, head
down, hands paddling the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man seemed to see neither horse nor rider till
he was almost into them. He stumbled, recovered
himself, and drew back out of the possible reach of a
possible sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Montfort—Montfort?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery reassured him, and he staggered forward
and leant against Aymery’s horse, panting out his news,
for he had run two miles or more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lording, there is an army on the march down
yonder. I was carrying faggots from a wood, when I
saw them riding out of the dusk. Their vanguard halted
under the wood, and I hid myself, and listened, and then
crept away and ran like a rabbit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He panted, pressing his ribs with his two hands, as
though his heart was gorged with blood. Aymery
bent down, and looked into the hind’s mud-stained
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick, good lad——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the van of the King’s host, lording, they are
riding on Southwark out of the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How near are they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wood is a mile beyond the cross where the
roads branch. They were resting their horses, the beasts
had been hard ridden, and their bellies were all
mud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery straightened in the saddle, and sat motionless.
The night gave no sound for the moment save
the soughing of the wind through some poplars that
grew near. Half a furlong away the darkness thickened
into a black curtain, hiding the world, tantalising
those who watched with the wraiths of a thousand
chances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, as they waited there on the wet road, a confused
sense of movement came to them from somewhere
out of the darkness, like the sound of the sea galloping
in the distance over a mile of midnight sand. Aymery
swept round, pulled off his glove with his teeth, and
threw it at the man’s feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look to yourself, my friend,” he said. “They
are coming through the night yonder. Bring that glove
to the Earl, and you shall have your due.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery clapped in the spurs, and went away at a
gallop. He did not doubt that it was the King’s
arms behind him, pouring upon Southwark to surprise
De Montfort’s weak force there, and take him
or slay him before the Londoners could gather to
his aid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Aymery galloped through the night, the lights of
Southwark and of the city beyond the river came to
him in a blur through the mist of rain. He did not
slacken even when he came to the outskirts of the place,
but rode straight for the Earl’s lodging, shouting to
those whom he passed in the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arm, arm,” was his cry as he galloped through.
“The King’s men are on us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so he brought the news to Simon the Earl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Montfort and his knights and gentlemen were at
supper, but they left the wine cups unemptied, and
made haste to arm. The Earl sent his son Simon to
ride across the bridge and rouse the train-bands in the
city. The narrow streets and alleys of Southwark
were soon in a great uproar with the running to and fro
of men, the tossing of torches, and all the tumult of a
hurried call to arms. A bell began to clash somewhere
up in the darkness. The narrow ways were full of
movement, of an infinite confusion that struggled and
chafed like waters meeting and beating against one another.
Trumpets blared. Leaders sought their men,
men their leaders. From beyond the river also bells
began to peal, the city was bestirring itself, and humming
like a hive of bees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery, rushing out from the Earl’s presence, ran
against a man with a fiery tangle of bright-red
hair. It was Waleran de Monceaux, that rebel of
rebels, driven by Gaillard out of Sussex. He caught
Aymery by the shoulder, and blessed God fiercely
because the Sussex men were the first to show their
shields.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother,” he shouted, “I have thirty spears for
a charge home. I heard you were here. Come. We
shall have the van.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went out together into the street where some
of the Earl’s men were already under arms. None the
less there was a dire tangle everywhere, the place choked
with disorder that promised well for the King’s men if
they lost no time. Aymery and Waleran found their
bunch of Sussex spears standing steady and stiff for the
night’s need. They were soon joined by other knights
and their men who gathered out of the wet gloom. De
Montfort himself came out, and ordered his archers
forward into the outskirts of the suburb, to scout
and discover what was happening in the darkness
yonder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shout rose suddenly, and went from mouth to
mouth. Young Simon came out of the darkness with
torches, riding his white horse, and a mob of half-armed
men with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sire, treachery, the gates at the bridge are locked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such in truth was the case, for the King had planned
the trick, and those of the wealthier citizens who were
in his pay had locked the gates and thrown the keys
into the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simon saw his imminent hazard, but his sword was
out to hearten his men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Break down the gates.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, standing in his stirrups:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sirs,” said he, “let the King’s men come to us.
They will find it hot here, despite the rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of archers came running back out of the
night, shouting that masses of men were pouring along the
dark streets at their heels. A blare of trumpets tore
the darkness. The narrow main street began to roar with
the rush of mounted men. The Earl’s trumpets gave
tongue in answer. In an instant a black torrent
poured forward as though a dam had broken, and
fell with fury upon the flood that lapped from wall to
wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man has no time to remember what happens in
such a fight when he is caught by a whirlwind of human
fury, and driven this way and that. Horses reared, fell,
and crushed their riders. The narrow street rang like
a hundred smithies. Blows were given and taken in
the darkness, men grappled together in the saddle, for
there was no room often for the swing of a sword. Aymery
found himself and his horse driven against the wall, and
pinned there by the mass that filled the street. He
struck out, with cries of “Montfort, Montfort,” and
was struck at in turn by those who bawled for
the King.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery found himself being forced along the wall
his horse, scared and maddened, backing along the street.
The tide had turned in the King’s favour. The Earl’s
men were being driven by sheer weight of numbers.
The night had a black look for Earl Simon and his
party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of what followed Aymery could have given no clear
account, all that he knew was that he went on striking
at those who struck at him, and that he remembered
wondering that he had not been wounded or beaten out
of the saddle. His brain seemed to become dulled by
the din and clangour, and by the tumult in the darkness
and the rain. A roar of voices rose suddenly, flowing
from somewhere out of the night. “Montfort, Montfort!”
A great rallying cry came up like the sound of
the sea, for the Londoners had broken the gates, and
were pouring over the bridge into Southwark to rescue
the Earl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while the fight stood still, and then slowly,
and with a sense of infinite effort it began to roll towards
the fields. New men seemed to come from nowhere,
streaming up alleys and side streets to break in on the
flanks of the King’s party. Aymery found himself with
space to breathe; his sword arm ached as though he had
been swinging a hatchet for an hour. Comrades came
up on either side of him, they gathered and pushed on,
shouting for Earl Simon, and fighting shoulder to shoulder,
Aymery found the street opening suddenly upon a small
square before a church. In one corner a torch had been
thrust into an iron bracket on the wall of a house, and
still burning brightly, despite the rain, it seemed to
serve as a rallying point for those whose stomachs were
not sick of the fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was becoming a hole and corner business now, a
question of group fighting against group, man against
man. Each party had been tossed into so many angry
embers, like a fire scattered by a kick of the foot. The
Londoners were still streaming over the bridge. Their
shouts of “Montfort, Montfort,” held the night. The
surprise had failed, thanks to the hind who had run two
miles in the mud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery was pushing his horse across the square,
battered shield forward, right hand balancing his sword,
when his eyes were drawn towards a skirmish that was
going on where the torch burnt in the bracket on the
wall. A big man in green surcoat, and mounted on a
black horse was keeping some of the Londoners at bay.
And behind the green knight, just under the torch, Aymery
saw a knight in a blue surcoat on a grey horse, a contrast
in colours that struck him as familiar. The blue knight
was taking no part in the tussle. His comrade
seemed to be defending him, backed up by a few
men-at-arms whose harness gleamed in the light of the
torch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery spurred forward, and came to blows with
the man in green. Nor had he had much to boast of
when a mob of Londoners came up at a run and broke
into the thick of the scrimmage. Aymery found himself
driven close to the knight in blue. He struck at him,
but the other seemed to have lost his sword, for he did
nothing but cover his head with his shield. Aymery
caught the blue knight’s bridle, and urged both the horses
out of the press. He had a glimpse of the man on the
black horse trying to plunge through the Londoners
towards him. But he was beaten back, and disappeared,
still fighting, into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery got a grip of the blue knight’s belt. The
man appeared to have little heart left in him, for he
dropped his shield, and surrendered at discretion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quarter, messire, quarter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice that came through the grid of the great
battle helmet seemed more the voice of a boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery kept a firm hold of the gentleman, and rode
back with him into the main street. The grey horse
went quietly as though thoroughly tired of the night’s
adventure. Aymery had no trouble with either beast
or man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great crowd had gathered at the bridge head.
Earl Simon was there, guarded by an exultant and
shouting mob of Londoners who were carrying him across
the bridge into the city. The crowd was so great that
Aymery had to halt with his prisoner, and bide his time.
Torches had been lit and their glare and smoke filled the
street where a thousand grotesque faces were shouting
“Montfort, Montfort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery felt a hand touch his arm, for he still had
hold of the blue knight’s sword belt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, messire, see what manner of prisoner you have
taken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blue knight had lifted the great helmet and let
it fall with a clash upon the stones. Aymery saw masses
of dark hair flowing, and a white face looking into his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother of God,” said he, “what have we here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A woman, lording,” and she laughed a little, and
then said again, more softly: “A woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery scanned her by the light of the torches, and
it seemed to him that he had seen her face before. Her
hair was dark as night, her skin the colour of a white
rose, and she looked at him with eyes that seemed full
of an amused yet watchful glitter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the moment Aymery thought of letting her go
free, but the lady herself appeared to have no such ambition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am in your hands, messire,” she said. “Keep me
from the mud and the mob, and I will thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery asked her name, being puzzled to know what
to do with such a prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name?” and she laughed, and gave him a
look that was meant to challenge a possible homage.
“I dropped my name with my shield. Nor would you
know it if I told it you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery was asking himself what had best be done
with this lady in man’s guise. To many men the answer
would have been gallant and none too difficult. But
Aymery coveted neither the responsibility nor the possible
romance. Nor was he sorry when a happy chance intervened
between him and the dilemma.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of knights came riding out of Southwark
with Simon the Younger on his white horse at their
head. And Simon who was an adventurous and hot
headed gentleman with the eyes of a hawk when a woman
was concerned, caught sight of Aymery and his prisoner,
and swooped down instantly towards the lure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, my friend, who are you, and what have you
here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery showed his shield, but the Earl’s son recognised
his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Aymery, out of Sussex! And what is this
treasure, messire, that we have taken?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sound of Aymery’s name the woman’s eyes
had darted a look at him, like the momentary gleam of a
knife hidden under a cloak. Then she moved nearer to
young De Montfort, and was soon speaking on her own
behalf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bowed gallantly to her when she had done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since you offer us no name, madam,” he said.
“Let us call you Isoult of the Black Hair. I am Simon,
the earl’s son. Also, I am your servant, unless our
friend here stands between us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery renounced all prestige, not having Simon’s
capacity for instant infatuations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is no concern of mine, sire,” he said, with a
bluntness that was hardly courteous to the lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A laugh hailed this frankness. De Montfort’s son
was looking at Etoile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will it please you to command my courtesy?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etoile smiled at him. He took her bridle, and they
went riding together over London Bridge into London
City. Nor did Simon guess that this was the first ride
along a tortuous road that would lead him to bring
death upon the great earl, his father.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Winter had come, and since Denise’s cell stood on the
northern slope of Mountjoye Hill, it was bitter cold
there, nor would the north wind be stopped by such
things as a thorn hedge or a closed door. To Denise
the cold was but part of the misery that was closing upon
her, for people were hardier in those days, and less softened
by the luxury of glass and carpets. But it was not the
cold that kept her wakeful through the night, but the
blank and unpitying face of the future that never departed
from before her eyes. Denise knew the truth now, and
soon the world might know it also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Abbey folk had sent her no winter gear, but that
was Dom Silvius’s affair, perhaps due to his meanness, or
his discontent with her, or to the feeling that a recluse
whose prayers went unanswered needed to be chastened
by wind and frost. It seemed very far from that day
in May when the meadows were sheeted in gold, and the
singing boys sang her into the Abbey <span class='it'>leuga</span>. Denise
would have had no winter clothes, had not a good woman
who distrusted Dom Silvius, sent her a lamb’s-wool tunic,
and a cloak lined with rabbit’s skin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the winter deepened, and Denise saw always that
shame that was coming nearer day by day. She knew
now how utterly she had failed, and the reason thereof
seemed in herself. Life had thrust hypocrisy upon her
insidiously and by stealth. She would have fled from
it, but the wide world seemed cold and empty, nor was
she free to follow her own will. Reginald the Abbot
was her lord now, both in the law and in the spirit,
he could have her taken if she fled, condemned, whipped,
and turned forth with contumely in the eyes of all.
Denise had her woman’s pride, a pride that shrank
from the thought of a public scourging and of open
shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two weeks or more after Christmas, on a clear frosty
morning, three women came to Denise’s cell, and one
of these women was the smith’s wife, Bridget. They
had loitered on the road awhile, talking volubly, priming
one another for some enterprise. No one had come
near Denise for a month or more, save the Abbey servant
who left food at the cell, but never saw her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the three women came to Denise’s cell, and stood
before the closed door, smirking and making a mystery
of the event. They had christened each other “Warts,”
“Sterility,” and “Thorn-in-the-Thumb,” and their
business was to win a glimpse of Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dame Bridget, or “Thorn-in-the-Thumb,” made a
devout beginning. She was a big woman with a high
colour, and a mouth that was generally noisy, a woman
of coarse texture, and of gross outlines that showed
Nature as a craftswoman at her worst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bridget had picked up some Latin words, and she
began with these, as though such a prelude would impress
Denise with their seriousness in coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sister,” she said with a snuffle, when she had come
to the end of her Latinity. “Here are three poor
women in need of a blessing. We pray you to come
out to us, Holy Sister, and to touch us with your
hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had no thought of treachery that morning,
and she opened her door, and stood there on the threshold.
The three women were kneeling humbly enough in the
wet grass, their hoods drawn forward, their hands together
as in prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bridget showed a thumb red and swollen about the
pulp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a thorn twig in a faggot, Sister,” she said.
“I laid my hand to the sticks, and the thorn went into
my thumb. It has kept me awake o’ nights with the
pain of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Sterility had a hearing, and while Denise bent
over her, for the woman chose to whisper, Thorn-in-the-Thumb
nudged Warts with her elbow, and stared Denise
over from head to foot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lastly, Warts displayed her imperfections, looking
most meekly into Denise’s shadowy eyes. And when
Denise had touched them all and given them her blessing,
the three women departed, walking very circumspectly
till they gained the road. Then Thorn-in-the-Thumb
flung her arms about the necks of her neighbours, crumpled
them to her, and laughed gross laughter that was not
pleasant to hear. And they went up the hill together,
gaggling like geese, blatantly exultant over the thing that
they had discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very soon hardly a man or woman in the five boroughs
of Battle had not heard what Bridget and her neighbours
had to tell. Rumours had been rife of late, but this last
cup was spiced with the palatable truth. The women
spoke more loudly than the men, were more strenuous
and vindictive, more self-righteous, more eager to have
the hypocrite proclaimed. Mightily sore were some of
the worthy folk who had gone on their knees for nothing
before Denise’s cell. They were quick to cry out that
they had been cheated, more especially those who had
left an offering to bribe the Blessed Ones in Heaven.
The insolence of this jade, setting herself up as a virgin
and a saint! “Out with her,” was the common cry.
As for Dom Silvius he was little better than a fool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With all these hornets humming even in the midst
of winter, some of the older burghers and the head men
of the boroughs went secretly to speak with Dom Silvius,
and to show him discreetly how matters stood. Such an
open sore needed healing; it was an offence and
an insult to St. Martin, and the saints. Old Oliver
de Dengemare was their spokesman, a man with a wise
eye and a sagacious nose. Dom Silvius kept an imperturbable
countenance, and heard them out to the
bitter end, though inwardly he was aflame with wrath
and infinite vexation. “The jade, the impudent jade.”
His brain beat out such imprecations while the old men
talked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No sooner had they gone than he crept off to whisper
it all to Reginald the Abbot. Now Reginald was a man
of easy nature, bland, kindly, one who chose a suave word
rather than a sour one. Silvius came to him, cringing
yet venomous, slaver dropping from his mouth as he
stuttered and spat his wrath. He took the thing as
infamous towards himself; the greed, the self-love, and
the ambition in him were tugging at the leashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them hound her out and spit upon her,” he
said, driving the nails into the palms of his hands, the
muscles straining in his pendulous throat. “Let them
spit upon her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abbot Reginald placed the sponge of his placidity
over Dom Silvius’s mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother,” he cautioned him; “such things should
not be spoken till the anger is out of one. A hot head at
night calls for penitence in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He saw very clearly how matters were with Silvius, that
the monk’s zeal had turned sour, and sickened him; and
that he was mad that all his astuteness should have taken,
in the eyes of his little world, the motley of the fool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are too hasty, my brother,” he said. “Does a
man whose wife has lost her virtue, shout it from the
house-tops? Come, my friend, let us consider.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Silvius would not be appeased. The fanatical
cat had spread its claws, a beast more cruel than any
creature out of the woods. Reginald of Brecon watched
him, as a fat man who had dined well might watch the
petulant tantrums of a child. He took to turning the
ring upon his finger, a trick habitual with him when he
was deep in thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is growing dark,” he said at last, glancing at the
window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he rose and stood awhile before the fire. Silvius
had ceased to spit and to declaim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My cloak and hood, Brother Silvius. You will find
them there in the recess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The monk obeyed his lord. When he returned with
the cloak, Reginald held up two fingers, and spoke one
word:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was not the glimmer of a star in the sky when
two dim figures climbed Mountjoye Hill. A north
wind was blowing and whistled coldly into Reginald’s
sleeves. Dom Silvius jerked from side to side, looking
restlessly into the darkness as though his blood were
still hot and bitter in him despite the cold. Reginald
understood the savage impatience that possessed his
monk, for he bade him wait at the gate in the hedge,
and went on alone to the cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius kept watch there, striding to and fro, blowing
on his nails, and beating his arms against his body like
a great black bird. He envied his Abbot the rights of
an unbridled tongue, for Silvius would have been a libertine
that night in the matter of godly invective and abuse.
He could hear voices, the dull, half-suppressed voices of
people who spoke earnestly, and yet with passion. Once
he thought that something stirred in the hedge near him,
for he was startled, and stood still to listen. A prowling
fox might have taken fright, or a bird fluttered from
its roosting place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile on the threshold of that dark cell stood
Reginald the Abbot, shocked, unable to retain much
store of anger. A shadowy something knelt there close
to him. The very heart of Denise seemed under his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, let me go,” was all that she could ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And again—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, let me go, away yonder, into the dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald looked down at her from the serene height
of his abbacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daughter,” he said at last, with no sententiousness,
“go, and God pity you. It is better that this should
end. Yet, wait till the day comes. You would lose your
way on a night such as this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will wait, lord,” she answered, utterly humble
because of his kindness, and her own poignant shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Abbot Reginald returned through the gate
in the thorn hedge, Dom Silvius’s voice hissed at him out
of the darkness, for the cold had sharpened a venomous
tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The jade, has she confessed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald was possessed by a sudden unchristian lust
to smite Dom Silvius across the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son,” he said very quietly, “take care how
you cast stones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he was more cold to Silvius on the homeward
way than the breath of the winter wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Silvius, that dreamer of dreams, that most mundane
monk, who thought more of the jewels crusting a reliquary
than the Cross of Christ, did a vile and a mean thing
that night. Denise, poor child, was to slip away, so
Reginald said, at dawn; but Reginald did not tell
Dom Silvius that he had left money on the stones whereon
she knelt. And Silvius, still venomous because he deemed
himself befooled, took pains to betray Denise’s secret
going. And the method of the betrayal was the meanest
trick of all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had seen Abbot Reginald safe within the
Abbey, he called two servants and went out with a basket
of victuals to visit certain of the sick poor. That the
hour was a strange one for such charity counted for
nothing with Silvius whose head was full of the ferment
of his spite. Many of the folk had gone to their beds,
but some few he found still lingering about the covered
embers on the hearth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was counted for holiness to Silvius that he should
come on God’s errand at such an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feed my sheep,” the Lord had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Silvius fed certain of them that night with
hypocritical humilities, shaking his head sadly, and dropping
a few treacherous words like crumbs into mouths
that hungered.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A red, wintry dawn was in the east when Denise stood
ready for her flight from the Abbey lands, her rabbit-skin
cloak about her, and the hood drawn over her head.
She had knotted the money that Reginald had given
her into a corner of her under tunic, and the food that
she had saved from yesterday she carried wrapped in
a clean cloth. Denise had thought of seeking Grimbald,
but her heart had failed her at the thought of meeting
the familiar faces of the people who had looked upon
her as something superhumanly pure and wonderful.
The passion that obsessed her for the moment was the
passion to escape from the inquisitive eyes of those who
knew her, and to slip away into the world where she
would be nothing more than a mere woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A robin twittered on the thorn hedge as she left
the cell and, crossing the grass, went out by the wicket
gate. The land was white with hoar frost, each twig
and blade beautiful to behold, and the arch of the east
red with an angry dawn. The hills looked big and blue,
and very sombre, and in the north the sky had an opaqueness
as of coming snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brittle silence of a frosty morning seemed unbroken
as yet, and Denise, after looking half fearfully
about her, came out from the shadow of the thorn hedge,
and walked quickly in the direction of the road. She
would be away and over the Abbey bounds before anyone
knew in the town that she had gone. Reaching the road,
she climbed down the path into it, for the road ran in
a hollow there. A bramble had caught the latchet of
her shoe and pulled it loose, and Denise bent down to
refasten it, putting the cloth with the food on the bank
beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Dom Silvius’s treachery had betrayed her to
the people, and Denise, as she fastened her shoe-latchet,
was startled by a shrill, gaggling laugh that seemed to
rise out of the ground close to her. The banks on either
side of the road were covered with furze bushes, and a
number of these bushes were suddenly endowed with the
miraculous power of movement. They rose up from
where they had grown, and came jigging down the steep
banks into the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover these same furze bushes burst into loud
laughter, and began to crow with exultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A miracle, a miracle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“St. Denise has worked a wonder, at last!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy virgin, see how the bushes dance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise stood still at the foot of the bank, and the
furze bushes came jigging round her like mummers in
a mask. Flapping skirts and shuffling feet gave a human
undercurrent to the green swirl of the furze. Now and
again she saw a red, triumphant face, or a pair of brown
arms holding a bough, while the frolic went on with giggles
and little screams of laughter. Then, at a given shout
from one of them, these women of the winter dawn
flung their furze boughs upon Denise, as the Sabines
threw their shields upon Tarpeia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thorns were as nothing compared with that circle
of coarse and jeering faces that stood revealed. Old
hags with white hair, skinny arms, and flat bosoms;
women in their prime, rough and buxom, with
hard features and loud mouths; young girls, whose
tongues were pert and insolent. Bridget, the smith’s
wife, led this wolf pack, like a hungry and red-eyed
dam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s face was bleeding, but she did not flinch
now that her pride had been driven against the pricks.
She looked round at the women, holding her head high,
although they had beaten her across the face. And
for the moment the women hung back from her as she
pushed the furze boughs aside, and made as though to
pass on without answering a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bridget, the smith’s wife, stood in her path. She
flung up her head and laughed like a great raw-boned
mare, and an echo came down from Mountjoye Hill
like the answering neigh of a horse. On the ridge above,
where the dawn light shone, were crowded the men who
had come out to see their women bait Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bridget began the savage game with a word that
brought the blood to Denise’s face. The women shrieked
with delight. Taunts struck her on every side as they
crowded close on her, gloating, screaming, their mouths
full of cursing and derision. They began to shake their
fists, and to stretch their claws towards her, and the
smell of their bodies was in her nostrils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bridget swung forward, and spat in her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She would work miracles, this jade, this wanton!
Where is my boy, you minion? Answer me that, I
say!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is your man, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We know him, we know him! Let him show his
face here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at her, the pretty jade!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spoil her beauty. Strip her naked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out with the harlot. Let her freeze.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Warts, Sterility, and fifty more were howling about
her, drunk with the very noise they made. For a moment
Denise stood white-faced in the midst of them. Then
she disappeared in a swirl of coarse and violent movement,
like a deer that is dragged down and smothered
beneath the brown bodies of the wolves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The road that morning was a martyr’s way as the
redness of the dawn waned and the sky became cold and
grey. Mouths spat upon her, hands smote her, and
clutched at her clothes. Buffeted at every step, jostled,
and torn, she was brought to the boundary of the Abbey
<span class='it'>leuga</span>, and driven out thence into the world. The women
even caught up stones and pelted her when they had
let her go, screaming foul words, and laughing in loud
derision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was as dazed and as exhausted as though
she had been wrecked, and washed ashore half dead
by some lucky wave. Her face was bruised and bleeding,
her clothes in tatters, her tunic torn open so that her
bosom showed. She drew her ragged clothes about her,
and went unsteadily down the road, with the cries of
the women still following her as she went. Denise’s
pride made a last brave spreading of its wings. It carried
her beyond the sound of those voices, though her feet
dragged, and her knees gave under her, and a kind of
blindness filled her brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps she struggled on for a mile or more before
she turned aside, and lay down under some hazels beside
the road. And as she lay there, dull-eyed, grey-faced,
and still half dazed, the power to think came back like
the sense of reviving pain. Horror of herself and of the
world took hold of her by the throat. It was as though
those women had spat upon her soul, and made her revolt
from herself as from something unclean. Those mocking
faces symbolised the mercies of her sister women. All
those who knew the truth would scoff, and draw away
their skirts. She was an outcast, a thing whose name
might broider a lewd tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was no ignorant child, but a grown woman,
yet she was weak and in pain, and her very weakness
made her anguish the more poignant. She lay there a
long while under the hazels, not noticing the cold, nor
the sodden soil, for her heart seemed colder than the frost.
Life held its helpless, upturned palms to the unknown.
What use was there in living? God had deserted her,
and had suffered her innocence to be put to shame.
She was too weary, too miserable even for bitterness or
for rebellion. Inert despair had her, body and soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently a boy came along the road towards Battle,
driving an ass laden with paniers full of bread. Close
to the spot where Denise lay under the hazels, the ass
was taken with the sulks, and stood obstinately still.
The boy tugged at the bridle, shouted, thwacked the
beast with his stick, but make her budge he could not.
Denise sat up and watched him, this piece of byplay
thrusting a wedge between her and the apathy of despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy was a sturdy youngster, with brown face,
brown smock, and brown legs splashed with mud. He
rubbed his nose with a brown hand, and catching sight
of Denise, took her to be a beggar, and perhaps a bit of
a witch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi, there,” he shouted, “give over frightening the
beast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is none of my doing,” she said, surprised somehow
at the sound of her own voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She stopped here, none of your tricks, old lady,”
said the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise put back her hood, and the youngster stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord,” said he, “you have been fighting, and you
are not old, neither!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His curiosity was curtailed by the curiosity of the
ass, who took to kicking, sending sundry loaves rolling
on the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hi, there, come and help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise rose up, and went towards the struggling pair.
She took the bridle from the boy, and began to pull the
donkey’s ears, to rub her poll, and talk to her as though
she were a refractory child. The beast grew suddenly
docile, and the bread was saved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise helped the boy to pick up the loaves. He
looked hard at her when they had refilled the paniers,
and then offered one of the loaves to Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take it,” he said almost roughly, yet with the
brusqueness of a boy’s good-will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be missed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy gave a determined shake of the head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father’s bread. The jade served him the same
trick last week, kicked the loaves on to a dung heap. He
can’t blame me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thrust the loaf into Denise’s hand, gave her a
friendly grin, and cut the ass viciously across the hind-quarters
with his stick. The response on the beast’s
part was a wild and hypocritical amble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This simple adventure on the road heartened Denise
in very wonderful fashion, even as the voice of a child
may interpose between a man and murder. It was like
a mouthful of wine in the mouth of one ready to faint
upon a journey. Denise watched the boy disappear,
hardly thinking that she had been saved from despair
by the obstinacy of an ass. She had the loaf in her
hand and the boy’s smile in remembrance, and the
mocking voices of the morning seemed less shamefully
persistent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise broke and ate some of the bread, and finding
a ditch near with a film of ice covering it, she broke the
ice with her shoe, and soaking one corner of her tunic
in the water, she washed the blood from her mouth and
face. It was then that she found the money that Abbot
Reginald had given her still knotted up in her clothes.
And these two things, the bread and the money, comforted
her with the thought that she was not utterly
forgotten of God. Both blessings had come to her by
chance, but when a soul is in the deeps it catches the
straws that float to it, and believes them Heaven-sent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite her wounds and her bruisings Denise walked
five miles before noon. The passion to escape from
familiar faces and to sink into the outer world, had
revived in her. She skirted Robertsbridge and its
Abbey, crossing the Rother stream by a footbridge
that she found. On the hill beyond she met a pedlar
travelling with his pack, and taking out a piece of money
bought a rough brown smock from him, a needle and some
thread. About noon she found some dry litter under the
shelter of a bank of furze. She put on her brown smock,
and mended her cloak, and then despite the January cold,
such an utter weariness came upon her that she fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Denise awoke it was with a rush of misery
into the mind, a misery so utter that she wished herself
asleep again, even sleeping the sleep of death. She was
so stiff with the cold and her rough handling that it hurt
her to move, and the infinite forlornness of her waking
made her shudder. Something soft touched her face,
like the drifting petal of apple blossom out of the blue.
A wind had risen and was whistling through the furze
bushes, and buffeting them to and fro. The sky had
grown very sullen. Snow was beginning to fall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise dragged herself up and drew her cloak closer
about her. She must find shelter for the night somewhere,
unless she wished to tempt death in the snow.
Yet she had gone but a short way along the road when a
sudden spasm of pain seized her, pain such as she had
never felt before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise stood still, clenching her hands, her eyes full
of a questioning dread. The spasm passed, and she
went on again slowly, the flakes of snow drifting about
her, the sky and the landscape a mournful blur. She
had walked no more than a furlong when the same pain
seized her, making her catch her breath and stand quivering
till the spasm had passed. Nor was it the pain alone
that filled her with a sense of infinite helplessness and
dread. The birth of a new and terrible consciousness
seemed to grip and paralyse her heart. She knew by
instinct that which was upon her, a state that called up
a new world of shame and tenderness and fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise went on again, a woman laden with the simple
and primitive destiny of a woman. It so happened that
she came to a wood beside the road, and at the edge of
the wood under the bare branches of the trees she saw
a lodge built of faggots, and roofed with furze and heather.
The place seemed God-sent in her necessity, and her
anguish of soul and body. Denise found it empty, save
for a mass of dry bracken piled behind some faggots in
one corner of the lodge. The place had a rough door
built of boughs. Denise closed it, and hid herself in
the far corner of the lodge, sinking deep into the bed of
bracken. The pangs were upon her, and all the dolour
and the foreboding that take hold of a woman’s heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was bitter cold that night, and the snow came
driving from the north, a ghost mist that wrapped the
world in a garment of mystery. The wind roared in the
trees whose bare boughs clapped together, creaking and
chafing amid the roaring of the storm. It was a night
when sheep would die of the cold, or be smothered in the
snow drifts banked against the hedges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sky began to clear about dawn, patches of blue
showing between ragged masses of grey cloud. The
sun shone out fitfully at first, flashing upon a white world,
upon a world of brilliant snow schemes and glittering
arabesques, with the wood’s sweeps of black shadow
across a waste of white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind had dropped, and there was the silence of
snow everywhere, not a voice, not a sound, save the
occasional creaking of a rotten bough and the swish of
its falling snow. The sun climbed higher, and the whiteness
of the world became a pale and blinding glare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, the silence of the wilderness was broken that
morning by a slow and steady sound that grew on the
still air. It was the muffled beat of hoofs upon the snow
of the road that ran southwards along the ridge of the
hill. Presently the snorting of the horse, jingle of metal
and the creaking of leather were added to the plodding
of the hoofs. A man’s voice rang out suddenly into a
burst of song. The white world was glorious in the
sunshine, marble and lapis lazuli, with flashes here and
there of gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The muffled beat of hoofs ceased by the wood where
stood the lodge built of faggots. The snow was virgin
about it, and the man turned his horse towards the wood,
swung out of the saddle, and began kicking the snow
aside as though to give the beast a chance of cropping
the grass. Taking wine and meat from a saddlebag,
he brushed the snow from a log that lay outside the lodge,
and sat down to make a meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'> And as he sat there in the sun he talked to his horse,
and gave the beast some of the bread from his own
breakfast. The horse nosed against him like a dog, its
breath steaming up into the frosty air, its eyes the colour
of sapphires seen against the snow. And there were no
sounds save the man’s voice, the breathing of his horse,
and the dripping from the boughs as the snow thawed in
the sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In due course the man remounted, and rode off down
the road with the morning sunlight upon his face. Cowering
on the bracken in the lodge Denise lay dazed, and
weary, hands and feet numb with the cold. She had
prayed to God that the man might not enter the place,
and find her there on her bed of bracken. He had been
so near to her that she had been able to hear the sound
of his breathing, and even the breaking of the crust of
the bread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside her on the bracken lay a white thing that
neither moved nor uttered a cry. Denise lay and stared
at it, half with dread and mute wonder, half with a passion
of primeval tenderness that was too deep for tears. And
as Aymery rode away from her into the morning, she kept
her vigil beside that innocent thing that did not whimper
and did not move. The snow and the secret silence
thereof seemed part of her life that morning, and the
eyes of the world were full of a questioning mist of tears.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery went riding southwards over the snow, a cloak
of furs over his harness, and the leather flaps of his
steel cap turned down to cover cheeks and ears. He
rode alone, for though the gilt spurs were at his heels,
his purse saw little of the colour of gold, and his horse
and his arms were all that he had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was peace in the land that January, for men
had put up their swords, and delivered their quarrel
into the hands of the King of France. It was the month
of the Mise of Amiens, when Louis, Saint and King, sat
to judge between Henry of England and his people.
Men trusted in that Holy Heart, that Flame of Sacred
Chivalry, that had brought peace to France, and given
God martyrs on Egyptian sands. But Louis was a
King judging between a King and turbulent towns and
still more turbulent barons. Nor was it strange, therefore,
that a saint, from whose mouth should have sprouted
an olive branch, hurled back over the sea a two-edged
sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A truce had been called, and with the sheathing of
his sword, Aymery had seized the chance and the time
to ride southwards into Sussex. Goldspur manor house
was a black ruin, but the manor folk were there, with
Grimbald to see that an absent lord was not forgotten.
No forfeiture had been proclaimed, and Aymery had
saddled his horse Necessity, and ridden to see whether
his villeins and cottars were honest men. Aymery had
left no steward over them, but Grimbald was more to
be trusted than any steward; no one would play him
any tricks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s road ran a devious way that January
morning, the road of a man who galloped ten miles out
of his path for the glimpse of a woman’s face. And
Aymery rode wilfully towards Battle, though Goldspur
lay over and away beyond the white hills in the west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About noon Aymery let his horse take his own pace
up the hill from Watlingtun. The slope of Mountjoye
seemed one sweep of virgin snow, and Aymery, looking
for Denise’s cell, marked it out above the thicket of
oaks where he had kept his vigil that summer night.
When he came to the place where the path should turn
aside from the road, he saw a muddy and much trampled
track leading over the snow towards the cell with its
hedge of thorns. It looked to Aymery as though the
whole countryside had made a pilgrimage to Denise of
the Hill. He followed the path in turn, giving Denise
her glory with the sadness of a man who cherishes an
impossible desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ground about the gate in the thorn hedge had
been trampled into a quagg of mud as though many people
had passed to and fro that morning. Aymery dismounted,
and threw his bridle over the gate post, numbering himself
among those who had come for Denise’s blessing. But
the sight he saw startled him not a little, for there was
no benediction to be won there that morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door of the cell stood open, and before it, in
the middle of a space of trampled snow, two of the Abbey
servants were heaping up straw and faggots as though
for a fire. The trampling of Aymery’s horse had been
deadened by the snow, the men had not heard it, and
he stood at the gate, watching them and wondering what
this meant. The two men went to and fro into Denise’s
cell, carrying out the wooden bed, the straw, and the
sheets thereof, her prayer stool, and cross, and other
lesser things, for Silvius in his first ardour had seen her
better housed than a mere recluse. The men piled
everything upon the faggots, and then stood aside in
silence as though waiting for someone’s coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery tarried no longer, but marched out from the
shadow of the thorn hedge, a voice crying in him: “Can
it be that she is dead?” The two servants saw him,
and for some strange reason began to handle their staves,
while one of them went to the door of the cell, and spoke
to someone within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dom Silvius and Aymery came face to face outside
Denise’s cell that morning, for the monk had been within,
watching the unclean things carried out for the burning.
He came out with a lighted torch in his hand, ready with
canonical curses, hot and hungry for the chance of scolding
the whole world. But when Silvius saw Aymery, he
seemed to grow cold of a sudden, and thin with a malicious
carefulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Silvius saw the hauberk and the gilt spurs, the
long sword at the girdle, the shield slung across the
back, the shoulder plates painted with a knight’s device,
the golden claw of a hawk. And Silvius sprang to sinister
conclusions with the intuition of a woman. Here, no
doubt, was the woman’s paramour, some hot-headed
gentleman who had ridden in to discover how things
fared with Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius took no notice of the Knight of the Hawk’s
Claw, but plunged his torch into the straw, and watched
the flames spring up and seize the wood. The smoke
rose straight up into the still air, turning to a pearly
haze as the sunlight touched it. The monk stood there,
with bowed head and folded arms, as though too busy
with his own prayers to be troubled by any stranger.
But prayer was very far from Silvius’s soul. His eyes
were wide awake under their lowered lids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery came two steps nearer. Silvius raised his
head and looked at him, and saw at a glance the face of
a man who was not to be repulsed or fooled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whom may you be seeking, my son?” he asked,
watching Aymery out of the corners of his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Knight of the Hawk’s Claw turned his head
towards the cell. Silvius seemed to enjoy an inaudible
chuckle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you have come for a blessing, messire?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As yet Aymery had not spoken a word, but Silvius
read his thoughts by the puzzled frown and the alert
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, my son,” he went on, beginning to sneer,
“you are wondering what has become of our saint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery looked from Silvius to the flames that were
leaping through the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has death been here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius’s eyes were netted round with cynical wrinkles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly your saint is both dead and alive,” he
said. “Some of you gentlemen have slain the saint
in her. I will not ask you, my son, whether the guilt
of the sacrilege is yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His sly, sneering face made Aymery’s manhood grow
hot in him. He was in no temper for sardonic subtleties.
Silvius saw a look in his eyes that betrayed a lust to take
someone by the throat. And Silvius kept the fire between
him and the man of the sword, nodding to the
two servants, and hinting without deceit that they should
be ready with their staves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son,” he said, licking his lips; “we are burning
the unclean relics of an unclean woman. If you ask me
for reasons, I send you to my lord, Reginald, at the
Abbey. His word is law here. I am but a humble servant
in God’s house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery looked Silvius in the eyes, and then turned
on his heel, with a face like ice. He mounted his horse,
and went up Mountjoye Hill at a canter, choosing to
gallop at the core of the truth rather than suffer Dom
Silvius to lick his lips and sneer. Nor had horse and
rider disappeared below the sky line before Silvius called
the two servants to him, gave them their orders, and
sent them away into the town. He himself tarried there
awhile, warming his hands at the fire that consumed
those relics of an unsaintly saint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Aymery came out from the presence of Reginald
of Brecon that day his face had the frozen bleakness of a
winter land. He walked stiffly, almost rigidly, with
nostrils that twitched, and hungered for air. The Abbey
servants fell back before him as he mounted his horse at
the gate. Here was a man who was not to be meddled
with. His face sobered them more than the face of a
leper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery struck his horse with the spurs, and the
beast leapt his own length, stood quivering a moment,
and then went away at a sharp gallop as though he
had the devil on his back. Aymery’s eyes looked straight
before him, eyes that caught the white glare of an inward
fury, and were blind to the outer world. The snow lay
white upon the roofs of the little town. Smoke ascended
tranquilly into a shimmer of sunlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery was not to ride out of Battle town at his
own pace; Dom Silvius had seen to that. At the sound
of a horn a crowd of figures seemed to start from nowhere;
men, women, and children came running together; the
whole wasps’ nest was on the wing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery drew up sharply, for the crowd in front of
him filled the street. He did not grasp the meaning of
it at first, but stared round at the people as though he
were but a chance actor in some chance scene. A stone
thrown from the crowd carried a rude hint, striking him
upon the shield that hung at his back. And with the
throwing of the first stone the whole mob sent up a sudden
roar of anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out, out, seducer!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pelt the sacrilegious dog!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is Dame Denise’s man, neighbours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drag him off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roll him in the mud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The uproar and the fury of the fools might have
dazed any man for the moment. The crowd came tossing
about Aymery’s horse, keeping a coward’s distance,
content as yet with stones, and filth, and curses. Thorn-in-the-Thumb
and her women were there, obscene and
violent, howling like cats, and urging the men on. Some
of them cut coarse capers, leering up into the knight’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery sat still in the saddle for a moment, looking
neither to right nor left. His lips were white and pressed
hard together, his eyes full of that shallow glare that fills
the eyes of an angry dog. The yelling and distorted
faces began to close upon him. A stone thrown by a
man near struck Aymery upon the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blood showed, but with it a blaze of wrath so terrible
and yet so silent, that hands which were uplifted did not
fling their stones. Aymery’s sword was out. He struck
his beast with the spurs, and rode straight into the thick
of the crowd. And though he smote only with the flat
of the blade, they tumbled over each other in their
hurry to give him room, while those who were safe stood
open-mouthed, staring like stupid sheep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery rode through them as he would have ridden
through a cornfield, swinging his sword, and laughing,
the terrible laughter of a man who has no pity. No
sooner did the rabble see his back, than their courage
came again, the courage of dogs that yap at a horse’s
heels. They scampered after him, shouting, screaming,
pelting him as they ran. Thorn-in-the-Thumb, with a
bloody poll from the flat of Aymery’s sword, panted along
with the very first, her apron full of filth that she had
brought with her from her kitchen, and kept gloatingly
until too late. But Aymery never turned his head, and
leaving the slobbering pack behind, rode at a canter out
of Battle town.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>One day early in March when dust and dead leaves were
whirling everywhere, old Fulcon the baker, the meanest
man—so it was said—in Reigate town, went to and fro
along the passage beside his house, carrying in faggots
that had been unloaded from a tumbril in the street.
The carter had thrown the wood against the wall, knowing
that Fulcon would not give him so much as a mug of
water for helping to carry the faggots into the shed behind
the bakehouse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulcon went to and fro along the passage like a brown
crab, a man whose back seemed built for burdens, and
whose bowed legs and hairy chest gave promise of great
strength. He carried the faggots two at a time, and
neighbours who loitered to watch him at work saw
nothing but the sheaves of wood crawling along upon a
knotty pair of legs. The boys of Reigate, who hated
the baker because he had good apple trees and used a
stick vigorously in defending the fruit, called him “tortoise,”
and “snail in the shell.” Sometimes a boy would
make a dash and pretend to try the snatching of a loaf
from the stone counter of the little shop. But Fulcon
had a dog who was as surly and as wide awake as his
master. Nor was it to be wondered at that dog Ban
had a sour temper, since the number of stones that
were surreptitiously thrown at him would have paved
the path in old Fulcon’s garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baker had come near the end of the load, and
had disappeared up the passage, leaving the last two
faggots lying on the footway. He came back, picking
up the odd bits of stick that littered the stones. A
bent body seemed such a habit with Fulcon that his
eyes often saw nothing more than the two yards of
mother earth before his feet. Hence he had already
laid a hand to one of the remaining faggots before he
saw the grey folds of a cloak spread out under his very
nose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulcon straightened up, and showed his natural
attitude towards the world by closing a big brown fist.
He saw a woman sitting upon one of the faggots, a woman
in a grey cloak with the hood drawn over her head. The
woman’s back was turned to him, and by the stoop of
her shoulders she seemed very tired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulcon took her for a beggar, and Fulcon hated beggars
even more than boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up,” said he.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And since she did not stir he repeated the command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get up, there,” and he reached out to take her by
the cloak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman rose, and overtopped Fulcon by some five
inches. She turned and looked at him with great brown
eyes that seemed tired with the dust and the wind. The
baker stared hard at her, catching the gleam of splendid
hair drawn back under the grey hood. The woman’s
face had a silence such as one sees on the face of a
statue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wood’s mine,” he said, grumbling into his beard,
and pointing a very obvious finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman looked at him, and then at the shop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want bread,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulcon’s eyes retorted “pay for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman had a leather bag in her hand. She
felt in it, and brought out money. Fulcon’s frown relaxed
instantly. He stooped under the wooden shutter
propped up by its bar, picked up a loaf, and handed it
to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To his astonishment she sat down again on the faggot,
as though she had a right there now that she had bought
the loaf. Fulcon opened his shrewd but rather sleepy
eyes wider, and stared. The words “get up” were again
on the tip of his tongue. But he smothered them, picked
up the other faggot, and giving a warning whistle to
the dog Ban who was lying in the shop, went away up
the narrow passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Fulcon returned, he stared still harder, for
the dog Ban was sitting with his muzzle resting on the
woman’s knee, and looking up steadily into her face.
She was breaking the bread slowly, and giving the dog
a crust from time to time. Fulcon might have reasoned
with her over such extravagance, had he not been the
creature of a strong affection with regard to the big
brown dog, one of the two living things in the world to
whom he grudged nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baker stood by, scratching his beard, something
very much like a smile glimmering in his eyes. Then
he gave a half audible chuckle as though the scene seemed
peculiarly quaint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman turned her head, but Fulcon’s face was
as blank as a piece of brown sandstone. He looked
indeed as though he had never uttered a sound in his
life. Dog Ban lifted his head and stared at his
master as though it was unusual for Fulcon to
chuckle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman asked a question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How far is it to Guildford?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulcon jerked his head like a wooden doll worked by
string.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guildford? It may be eighteen miles,” and he
reconsidered the number carefully as though he were
handing out loaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman laid a hand on the dog’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am tired,” she said suddenly. “I want a lodging.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A lodging.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulcon always echoed a neighbour’s sentences, a
trick that suggested caution, and a desire to gain time
for reflection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are hostels in the town,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are hostels in the town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” and yet again she repeated the blunt monosyllable
“no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulcon echoed the “no,” and stared hard at the
opposite wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ban opened his mouth suddenly, and laughed as a
dog can laugh on occasions. It was as though the matter
was so absurdly simple that he was tickled by the way
these humans bungled it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulcon caught the dog’s eye. Ban’s laughter
had been silent, his master’s came with a human
gurgle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want a lodging?” and he approached the
question as something wholly new and astonishing, a
matter that had never been previously mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman put back her hood, and gave Fulcon a
full view of her face. Perhaps he felt what Ban had
felt, for there was something in the woman’s eyes that
made both these surly dogs quite debonair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should give you no trouble,” she said simply.
“I have had trouble enough to teach me to be
contented.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulcon nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trouble,” he agreed. “There are many things that
bring trouble, more especially such a thing as a
King.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My trouble began with the King,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, to be sure; his men took all my bread
one day last year, and I had not so much as a
farthing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice grumbled down in the bass notes, and Ban
sympathised with a growl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman felt in her bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can pay you,” she said, “a little. I can work,
too, if you wish it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulcon narrowed his eyes suspiciously, and looked
at Ban as though for advice. The dog wagged his tail.
That wag of the tail decided it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come up and see,” he said. “I have a little room
under the roof.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all three went in together, Fulcon, the dog, and
Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether it was Ban’s friendship, or Fulcon’s complacency
in turning a good penny by letting his attic,
Denise tarried there in the baker’s house, glad to find a
corner in the world where she could rest awhile in peace.
Fulcon lived quite alone, though an old woman came in
now and again to cook, clean, and sew. The house was
of stone, and roofed also with flags of stone, because of
sparks from the bakehouse furnace. The upper room
where Denise lodged was reached by an outside stairway
from the yard. There was a small garden and orchard
shut in by the walls and gable ends of other houses.
As for Fulcon he lived in his bakery behind the shop,
he and Ban sleeping together in one corner like two brown
dogs curled up in a heap. Often there was baking to
be done at night, and then Fulcon dozed in the shop by
day, the dog keeping an eye open for customers, boys,
and thieves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is one of the facts of life that gruff and surly people
are more to be trusted than those with burnished faces
and ready tongues, and so it turned out with old Fulcon.
For Denise found him steady and honest. The neighbours
declared that Fulcon was a miser. True, he worked like
a brown gnome, round-backed, laborious, and silent.
No man baked bread better than Fulcon; nor had he
ever sold short weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Denise found herself tarrying day after day in the
town under the chalk hills, where the beech woods
clambered against the sky, and life seemed still and quiet.
Though Earl Simon had taken Reigate the year before,
no memory of violence and of bloodshed seemed to linger
there, and the valley amid the hills waited peacefully
for the spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had come very near to death that year, and
the heart in her still carried a deep and open wound.
She had changed, too, in those few weeks. Her glorious
hair was growing long again, and her eyes had a more
miraculous sadness. She was thinner in face, yet plumper
at the bosom. Some people might have discovered an
indefinable air about her, a subtle, human something
that was not to be seen on the face of a nun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great gulf had opened for Denise between the present
and the past, and what her thoughts and emotions were,
only a woman could understand. She had lost something
of herself, and there was a void of tenderness and yearning
in her that hungered to be filled. A chance touch of
kindness could melt her almost to tears. She was very
silent, and very gentle. Even the dog Ban was something
to be loved and fondled, and in winning Ban she won old
Fulcon, that brown gnome who toiled and hoarded,
hoarded and toiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day he called Denise from her upper room, and
showed her the door that led into the garden. Within
were herb beds, brown soil turned for planting vegetables,
and a stretch of grass where the apple and pear trees
grew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grass turns white under a stone,” he said in his
grumbling way. “You will see more of the sun
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Denise was grateful to the old man, and she went
down into the orchard of an evening, and heard the blackbirds
sing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Fulcon had taken a fancy to Denise. He began
to look upon her as a house chattel that was familiar,
and even as a possession to be treasured. She was silent
and gentle, and Fulcon was silent and gentle under that
gruff, ugly, and laborious surface. Denise paid him her
money, and though Fulcon took it, he kept it apart from
the hoard he had in a secret hole in the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Times are hard, dog Ban,” he would say sulkily.
“Only a priest takes a child’s last pence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ban would approve, knowing that his master was
less mean than he seemed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be sure, it is no common wench, dog Ban. Noble
folk fall into the ditch, as well as beggars. She may
be a great lady, who knows? No kitchen girl ever had
such hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Denise tarried there, and old Fulcon seemed quite
content that she should tarry, and even began to show
less reticence and caution. Old men are often like
children; they turn to some people, and run from
others. Nor was it long before Denise discovered why
the baker toiled and hoarded as he did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulcon had an idol, an idol that fed upon the father’s
gold, and that idol was a son. Denise heard of him as
a big, black-eyed, tan-faced sworder who had run away
to the wars before the down was on his chin. Fulcon’s
boy had swaggered, fought, and shouldered his way up
hill. He rode a great horse now, wore mail, and carried
a long spear. He earned good pay in the service of those
who hired such gentlemen, even had men under him, and
was a great captain in his father’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God of me, child,” he would say, “the boy was a
giant from the day his mother bore him! I can stand
under his arm, so,” and he would show Denise how his
head did not reach to his son’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The handsome dog, he must have money,” and
Fulcon chuckled and rubbed his hands, “there is not a
finer man at his arms in the whole kingdom than Hervé.
He has fought as champion often, and no man can stand
up to him. Lord, child, and the way some of the ladies
have shown him kindness, but that is not a matter for
your ears. Hervé must have money, the handsome dog!
A lad of such promise must live like the gentleman he may
be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Fulcon waxed mysterious, and looked at Denise
with cunning pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not given him all my money, oh no, I am
wiser than that, I bide my time. For though I have never
dreamt it, my dear, I know that some day Hervé will
win the spurs. Lesser men have fought their way to it.
And then, child, the old baker of Reigate will come out
with a store of gold. Arms, and rings, and rich clothes
shall the lad have. He shall not be put to shame for
lack of the proper gear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was touched by the old man’s love for his
son, and also by the trust he showed her in telling her
such a thing. For to one who had been driven out into
the world with shame and ignominy, such human faith
is very dear. Denise might be touched by old Fulcon’s
pride, but whether she believed Messire Hervé worthy
of it was quite another matter. The fellow was probably
a gallant rogue, with wit enough to possess himself of
the old man’s gold. It seemed strange to her that
Fulcon, who was so shrewd and grim, should be dazzled
by gaudy trappings, a loud presence, and a handsome
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had at least found peace in the little town,
a time of tranquillity that stood between her and despair.
She had space there for quiet breathing, and no fear for
the moment but the fear of a chance betrayal. She
needed sleep and strength before the march into the
future, that future that seemed as dim and formless as
a strange and distant land. Her heart seemed doomed
to lose the very memory of a most dear dream. If she
thought of Aymery she thought of him as a man who
had made her soul thrill in past years, and was dead.
Her vows were broken, but what did that avail? The
past was dead also, after what had happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One evening late in March, Fulcon came to her in
the garden, and she could tell that he was troubled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The bloody sword is out again,” he said. “Bah,
I thought they would let us have peace awhile. The
accursed Frenchman has thrown poison into the
pot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was ignorant of much that had passed in the
world around. She knew nothing of the Mise, and of
the blight that had fallen on the Barons’ cause. Pope
Urban, good man, upheld King Henry in the breaking
of oaths and the casual selfishness of misrule. Time-servers
and waverers were going over to the King, because
of the award St. Louis had made. Yet Simon had carried
his head high, and acted in all honour, he and the chief
lords who were with him. They had surrendered Dover,
and prepared to treat loyally with Henry about the
Mise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now news had come into the town that the firebrands
on either side were flaming in arms. Roger Mortimer had
ravaged De Montfort’s estates on the Welsh marches.
There had been skirmishes in the west country. The
Earl of Derby had hoisted his banner against the King.
Henry himself had issued writs calling his followers to
arms on the last day of March. The peacemaking of
Louis of France seemed likely to bring on a yet bitterer
war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulcon shook his head over it, and grumbled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The King pipes the tune, and poor John pays.
There will be bloody work again. God give Earl Simon
a heavy hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, as is always the case, he discovered compensations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hervé will have his chance,” he said; “how can a
soldier show himself without a battle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days passed, and news came suddenly that
Simon the Younger was near at hand, and likely to pass
through Reigate on the way. The news set Fulcon all
agog, for Hervé followed the Earl of Gloucester’s banner,
and some said the earl was with young Simon, and Fulcon
was as eager as any woman to see his lad. He went out
into the town, leaving Denise and Ban to look to the
loaves in the shop. And while Fulcon was away De
Montfort’s son marched into Reigate with a following of
knights and men-at-arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise saw the people running to and fro like ants
in a nest that have been stirred up with a stick. A
crowd began to gather, an anxious, whispering, restless
crowd, uneasy as a wood under the first puffs of a
threatening storm. For armed men in a town were too
often the devil’s retainers, were they friends or foes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of shouting came from one of the gates,
with the blare of trumpets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Simon is here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news spread, and men who had wives and daughters,
pushed them within doors, bidding them look
through cracks in the shutters if they must look at all.
A knight came riding by, carrying a black banner with
a white cross thereon. A few stray dogs ran hither and
thither, to be hooted, and pelted by the boys in the crowd.
Then suddenly, with the thunder of hoofs along the street,
came the clangour of young Simon’s company, their
spears set close together like black masts in a
haven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise stood at the door of Fulcon’s shop, with Ban
bristling and snarling beside her. A splendid knight
on a white horse rode in the van. His helmet was off,
and he laughed, and looked about him as he rode with
a certain good-humoured vanity. Beside him, mounted
on a black mare, Denise saw a woman in silks of blue and
green, and a cloak of sables over her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The way was narrow, and the crowd greatest just by
the baker’s shop. Simon the Younger reined in his
horse, holding his spear at arms length as a sign to those
behind him to halt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Room, good people,” he said, gracious and debonair.
“We are not here to trample on honest men’s
toes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s eyes met the eyes of the woman who rode
at young De Montfort’s side. And in that look the
shame of the near past leapt up into Denise’s face, for
the lady in the cloak of sables was the woman who had
ridden with Gaillard and Peter of Savoy the day they
dragged Aymery from her cell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etoile’s black eyes had flashed as they stared at
Denise’s face. She also had not forgotten. And once
again she looked down upon Denise, and mocked her
with lifted chin, and laughing mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The street had cleared, and Simon and Etoile went
riding on together, with spear and shield following along
the narrow street. Denise had drawn back into the
shadow of the shop, her face still hot with Etoile’s sneer.
Her shame seemed to have been flung at her like a torch
out of the darkness. Denise felt as though it had scorched
her flesh. And while she hid herself there, Aymery rode
by among young Simon’s gentlemen, but Denise neither
saw him, nor he her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon Fulcon came back panting, having pushed his
way through the crowd in the street. He blessed God
and Denise when he saw his bread untouched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five score loaves for Simon’s men,” he said gloating.
“I had the order yonder up at the Cross. Simon is a
lord who pays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulcon was very happy, but Denise went to her room
above, sorrowful and sad at heart. The peace seemed
to have gone suddenly from the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery, who had passed so near to her for whom
he would have pledged his spurs, served as knight of
the guard that evening at De Montfort’s lodging. Young
Simon and Dame Etoile were very merry together,
drinking and laughing into each other’s eyes. Aymery
distrusted the woman, and feared her power over the
earl’s son. It always seemed to him that he had seen
her face before that night in Southwark, but where,
for the life of him, he could not remember.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as he kept guard in Reigate town that night,
he thought of Denise, and of that dolorous thing that
had befallen her. The shame of it had not driven her
out of Aymery’s heart. Little did he guess that he had
been so near to her that day.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Simon the Younger went on his way, and Aymery with
him, Aymery whose face had lost some of its youthfulness
and caught in its stead the intensity of the life
that stirred the passions of those about him. All who
had kept troth with Earl Simon after the Mise were
men whose hearts were in their cause, and who set their
teeth the harder when the odds grew greater against them
day by day. Earl Simon’s spirit seemed like light reflected
from the faces of the stern, strong men who rallied
to him. De Montfort had no use for time-servers, or
the half-hearted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them go,” he would say; “we want no rotten
timber in our house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Prince Henry, Richard of Cornwall’s son,
sought the earl’s leave not to bear arms against his
father and his uncle, Simon bade him go, and return in
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For,” said he with scorn, “I would rather have
a bold enemy, than a cock that will crow on neither
dunghill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Hugh de Bigot, and Henry de Percy left him,
but Simon would not be daunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I, and my sons will stand for England, and the
Charter,” he said. “I will not go back from my purpose,
though I sacrifice my blood, and the blood of my children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was Simon the Earl when fate seemed against
him, and such were the men who gathered about him
with grim and silent faces, and the determination to
go through to the end. Ardour and high purpose were
theirs those months. The Mise had purged the cause of
slackness and mere self-seeking. The people of England
were to read the King a lesson that was never to be
forgotten by his masterful and more kingly son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some days after Simon the Younger had passed
through Reigate, a party of the King’s men came riding
into the town. They were very insolent and high-handed
gentlemen who swore that Reigate was a nest of rebels
because the townsmen had lodged Young Simon and his
following, and given them food. None other than Gaillard
commanded this company, Gaillard who was furious over
the news that a spy had brought him, the news that
Etoile had won young Simon as a lover. Gaillard spared
neither tongue nor fist in Reigate. These fat pigs of
English should be bled in return for the way De Montfort
had trampled on Gascony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard was never so happy as when he could tease
and bully. He and his men, who were mostly mercenaries
from over the sea, took possession of Reigate, and established
themselves strongly there. They terrorised the
place, doing much as their passions pleased, taking all
they needed, and robbing even the churches. So many
of them were drunk at night that had the townsmen
showed some enterprise, they could have risen and rid
themselves of the whole pack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Fulcon had shut up his shop, and baked only such
bread as he could serve out secretly to his neighbours.
But Gaillard soon heard of Fulcon’s frowardness, and came
riding down one morning to see such impudence properly
chastened. His men beat in the shutterflap of the shop
with their spear staves, and found Fulcon waiting sulkily
within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The baker had shut Ban up in an outhouse, knowing
that the dog would show fight, and have a sword thrust
through him for his pains. Gaillard’s men dragged
Fulcon out into the street, and brought him beside the
Gascon’s horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, you rogue, how is it that you bake no
bread?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I have no sticks,” said Fulcon surlily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We will give you the stick, dog, unless you send
us thirty loaves daily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fulcon shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no flour left,” he said, “and no fool will
send flour into the town,” and he grinned from ear to
ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard cursed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, you goat, you horned scullion, are we to
be starved! I will see to it that you have flour and
faggots. You shall bake us bread, you dog, or we will
bake you in your own oven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was in her room when Gaillard’s men broke
into Fulcon’s shop. There was no window looking upon
the street, and since Denise was no coward and wished
to see what was happening to Fulcon, she opened the
door and came out upon the stairway. As she stood there,
two of Gaillard’s men caught sight of her, and began to
call to her from the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See there, the old dog has a pretty daughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, my dear, come down and be kissed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard himself turned his horse, and looked up at
Denise. And Gaillard knew her, and she, him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise would have fled in and closed the door, but
she seemed unable to move, held there by Gaillard’s
eyes. The man’s face had flushed at first, but he covered
a moment’s sheepishness with a smile like the glitter of
sunlight upon brass. Perhaps he saw how Denise shrank
from him, and for a woman to shrink from him made
Gaillard the more insolent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sweet saint,” said he, laughing and looking up at
her, “what do we here? Have we grown tired of the
beech wood, and Gaffer Aymery, and the Sussex pigs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise closed her eyes, and stood holding the hand-rail
of the stair. She heard Gaillard laugh, and the sound
of his horse trampling the flints of the street. When
she opened her eyes, he was still there below her. And
the sight of the man filled her with such sickness and
loathing that she turned her head away as she would
have turned her head from some brutal deed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Courage, Sanctissima,” said he, “only ugly women
have no friends. Master Flour and Faggots shall be
treated gently for your sake. Speak for me in your
prayers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he called his men about him, and rode away
up the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise went into her room, and barred the door,
and sitting down on the bed, looked with blank eyes at
the walls of the room. A sense of utter helplessness
possessed her, so that she could neither pray nor think.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So great was her loathing of the man, so poignant her
repulsion, that she fell into a fever of unrest that night,
and could not sleep because of Gaillard. Denise knew
how much pity to expect from a man of Gaillard’s nature;
bolts and bars would not avail in the town if the Gascon’s
whim sought her out. She felt driven out again into the
world, to hide herself, to escape from the very thought
of the touch of Gaillard’s hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By dawn Denise had made up her mind. She would
slip out of the town, and throw herself once more into
the unknown. Life had so little promise for her, nor
was it in her heart to turn nun after what had passed.
She was ready to work as a servant for the sake of
a home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was not destined to leave Reigate town that
day, for Fulcon came climbing up the stairs soon after
dawn, and knocked softly at her door. He had been at
work that night, perforce, baking bread for Gaillard’s
men, but Fulcon had heard news, news that made him
grunt exultingly as he laboured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Child,” he said, “come down into the garden. I
have a word for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise unbarred her door, and followed Fulcon down
the stair. He saw that she was fully dressed, but he
said nothing, for Fulcon made a habit of sleeping in his
clothes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had gained the garden the baker shook
his fist at some invisible figure, but looked very sly and
cheerful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Gascon dog, the bully, the thief! They are
coming with whips to whip him out of the town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went close to Denise, and touched her on the
bosom with a thick forefinger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sweeting, I was afraid last night because of that
hot-eyed wolf. But last night we had news, we English
pigs. Tell me now, can you hear a bell ringing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise could not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, child, it is Paul’s Bell in London City. They
are up, the men of London, and have flung the Frenchman’s
judgment back into his face. ‘King stands by
King, and cobbler by cobbler. No Mise for us, but the
sword of Earl Simon.’ Bold lads, let them shout that!
London City has risen. Hear the wasps humming.
They are on the wing everywhere, stinging fire into
Richard the Roman’s manors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had never seen the little brown man so excited
before. His taciturnity had become voluble. Dog Ban,
sympathetic cur, set up a militant barking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This pig of a Gascon knows nothing. We were
sick of his wallowings, and we sent out our messengers.
To-night the men of London will be here. The Gascon
and his fools will be full of mead and wine. We shall
open a gate. Then let these foreign dogs die in the
gutter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Denise said nothing to Fulcon of her intended
flight, but chose to bide her time on the chance that
Gaillard would be driven out of Reigate. She had found
a refuge in the town, and she loved dog Ban, and
trusted Fulcon. Where else could she find a surer
shelter?</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Denise kept watch in her room that night, sitting at
her window that overlooked the garden. She could
hear old Fulcon moving restlessly to and fro below, opening
the door of the shop from time to time, and going out
into the street to listen. There was a full moon that
night, and though the town gleamed white under the
chalk hills, the narrow passage-ways and streets were in
deep shadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About midnight a suggestion of secret stir and movement
rose in the town. Denise heard footsteps go
stealthily by, as of people creeping along under the shadow
of the houses. Men stopped to whisper to one another,
and once she heard the sound of a sword dropped on the
cobbles. Fulcon had opened his shop door again, for
she heard the creak of the hinges. Then silence once
more smothered the town, save for an occasional flutter
of sound, like the flicker of leaves on a still night in
summer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour had passed, and Denise had begun to think
that nothing was to be done that night, when a burst of
shouting rose in the very centre of the town. So loud
and sudden was it, that all the dead might have risen
with one great and exultant cry, a cry that set the moonlit
night vibrating with the thrill of a coming storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a bell began to ring, quickly, volubly, with an
angry clashing to and fro. Denise heard men go rushing
by with a clatter of arms, laughter and loud oaths. Soon,
the whole town was in an uproar, and old Fulcon, standing
in the doorway of his shop, shouted and clapped his hands
together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tear them, good lads, tear them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wave of war had broken over the town, and went
splashing and plunging into every court and corner.
Denise opened the door at the top of the outside stair,
and stood listening to the roar of the fight, the wall of
the next house throwing a black shadow across her and
the stair. She could hear shouts and rallying cries, and
a sullen under-chant that seemed made up of blows,
curses, and the trampling of many feet. Confused and
shadowy figures went tearing hither and thither, appearing
and disappearing in the moonlight. A wounded and
riderless horse galloped by, screaming with terror.
Presently the glow of a fire coloured the sky with a blur
of yellow light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was leaning against the jamb of the doorway
when she saw a man come running down the street, a
naked sword in his hand, his shield held up as though
to hide his face. He stopped outside Fulcon’s shop,
dropping his shield arm, and looking about him cautiously,
yet thanks to the deep shadow he did not see Denise.
She took him for Gaillard, and was about to shut and
bar the door, when she heard Fulcon’s voice shrill and
thin with an old man’s joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hervé, Hervé!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man had disappeared round the angle of the
house, and Fulcon dropped his voice to a cautious whisper.
The door creaked and closed. Fulcon and the soldier
were together in the shop. Denise did not doubt that
it was Hervé his son who had come with the Londoners,
and such of De Montfort’s men who were with them
that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise heard them talking together, the younger
man’s voice loud and rather aggressive, Fulcon’s a mere
gentle and deprecating grumble. The son seemed to
be asking the father something, Fulcon to be putting
Hervé off with reasons and excuses. Before long the
younger man’s voice changed its tone. It began to
plead and to persuade with an insinuating light-heartedness
that Denise did not trust. Old Fulcon’s grumble
became more persuadable. Denise heard a door opened,
and then the sound of a man’s voice singing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The singing ceased. For some moments silence held,
to be broken by a sudden scuffling noise, and a voice,
thick and choking, crying “Hervé, Hervé!” A dog’s
growl joined in, fierce and threatening, to end in a piteous
and wailing whimper. Something seemed to struggle to
and fro with inarticulate anguish and horror. Then
silence fell. Nothing moved in the room below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was caught by an impulse that took no account
of self and of fear. She went down the stairway and into
the street, only to find the door of the shop barred. Her
hand was still on the latch when the door opened. The
man Hervé came out, huddling something under his
surcoat, his sword in the moonlight showing a shadowy
smear. He stopped dead on the threshold, staring at
Denise, and then pushed past her roughly, and fled up
the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a light burning somewhere behind the
shop, probably in the bakehouse where Fulcon and dog
Ban lived and slept. Denise went in, wondering what
she would find there, nor was she long in discovering
Messire Hervé’s handiwork. A candle was burning in a
sconce on the wall, and close to the great brick oven lay
Fulcon, stretched upon his back, one arm covering his
face as though to shut out the sight of something, or to
break the force of a blow. Ban, in his death agony, had
dragged himself to his master, and crouched there with
his forepaws on the baker’s chest. They were dead,
both of them, Fulcon and the dog. A black hole in the
wall showed above the place where Fulcon had fallen,
and the stone that had closed the hole lay close to the
old man’s head. Fulcon had hidden his hoard there,
the money that he had scraped together with infinite
labour for the sake of Hervé his son. Denise could guess
what had happened. Fulcon had not been willing to
part with the whole sum, because of his dream that Hervé
would need it when he came by knighthood. And the
son had watched the father go to the hiding-place in
the wall, and then had beaten him down, and taken all
that he could find.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great horror of the place seized on Denise, with
the two dead things lying there, and the brutal violence
of the deed making old Fulcon’s end seem pitiful and ugly.
The horror of it drew her out into the night, as though
to escape the sickly odour of freshly shed blood. Shuddering,
she went up to her room, put on her cloak, and
tied such money as she had left into a corner of her tunic.
The grossness of the deed had shocked her, so that she
fled away like a child from a haunted wood, forgetting
such a thing as justice, and the fact that her tongue
might drop a noose over Master Hervé’s head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whither she was going, or what her plans were, Denise
did not consider for the moment. Blind panic carried
her away from a thing that had filled her with pity, and
yet with disgust. She seemed hardly conscious of the
fact that fighting was still raging in the town. Houses were
on fire not fifty yards away, but the scattering
sparks and the glare above the house-tops seemed hardly
to strike her senses. The burning houses threw up
a flare to match the horror that possessed her; such
surroundings seemed natural and to be expected after
Hervé’s slaying and robbing of his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise found herself at last in an open space where
many people were gathered, and torches threw up tawny
light under the white face of the moon. Here was much
shouting, much running to and fro, much uproar and
exultation. Now and again a sword or axe flashed
above the black mass of humanity. As Denise came
out of the darkness a party of men went charging through,
carrying ladders, hatchets, and iron bars. “Room,
room,” they shouted, for they were bent on stopping the
spread of the fire by pulling down some of the flimsy
houses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the middle of the square sat a knight on horseback,
a knot of torches about him, and a pennon fluttering
faintly above the smoke. The motion of the crowd
seemed towards the knight, as though he were Lord and
King of the Play. Denise was caught in the crowd and
carried slowly towards the knight on the horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat there bareheaded, calm and a little grim, the
torchlight flickering on his face, and on the harness that
glittered under his tawny surcoat. Men went to and
fro carrying his commands, figures in red, blue, and green,
going and coming through the crowd. He spoke so
quietly that at a little distance no one heard his voice,
but saw only the lips move in his stern and watchful
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Aymery, lord of Goldspur, Knight of the Hawk’s
Claw, who had the command of the Londoners who had
rushed on Reigate. The crowd carried Denise close to
him, within an arm’s length of the circle of torches.
And with her nearness she seemed suddenly to awake
with a great cry of the heart that did not reach her
lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aymery, Aymery!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her utter loneliness in the midst of that crowd seemed
to her symbolical of the past and of the future. She was
just a child that moment, with the passionate and pathetic
longing of a child, touched with the deeper instinct of
the woman. And by chance Aymery looked straight at
Denise, so that it seemed to her that he was looking at
her, and at her alone. She did not realise that Aymery
could see nothing but a moving mist of faces because
of the torch flare and the smoke. His face was so grim
and intense, and his eyes so hard, that Denise shrank
back, believing that he had recognised her, and that he
looked at her as a thing of shame. She hid her face from
him with bitterness and humiliation, and crept away
into the thick of the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all that happened afterwards that night in Reigate
town Denise had but a confused memory. She remembered
being hurried along by the crowd, with shouting
and tumult in the dark alleyways and streets. She had
a memory of being crushed against a group of panting
and fiercely exultant men who had blood upon their
hot hands and faces. One of them had thrown an arm
round her and kissed her, laughing when she shuddered
and broke away. Once a couple of heads went dancing
by on the points of spears, heads that seemed to mock
with dead, open mouths at the jeering crowd below.
Men were still fighting in one corner of the town, for
Gaillard had got the remnant of his followers together,
and was struggling to break through. Denise, still carried
onwards, saw a black mass like the mass of a town
gate rising before her. She was pressed against a wall
as the crowd opened to let a file of mounted men ride
through. She saw Aymery in his surcoat of tawny gold
go riding under the arch of the gate, shield forward,
sword swinging, his men crowding after him like sheep
through a gap. Then the rush of the people carried
her through the town gate into the space outside
the barriers. And when the dawn came she found
herself a mile from Reigate town, sitting under a tree,
with a cold wind driving grey clouds across an April
sky.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Said Marpasse to Isoult:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the Lord had loved us he would have kept
the King at Oxford until we came there to drink
wine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Isoult, a little woman, the colour of ivory, lithe
and strong as a snake, threw a handful of sand at Dame
Marpasse, and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since they have taken Young Simon prisoner,”
she said, “there will be no chance for the like of us under
the banner of the Old Earl. God grant that Simon be
soon put under the sods. He would freeze all the young
men in the country. God prosper the King.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse had taken off one of her stockings, and
was darning a hole in the heel, and darning it very
clumsily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have slaughtered the Jews in London, and the
King should come south again to see after the remnant
of his flock. They say his host is moving nearer the
river. We must look to our manners, my dear; I will
be nothing under a great lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isoult shot out a red tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Supposing I look no lower than Prince Edward
himself! We must fill our purses soon. These cursed
marchings to and fro have left us out in the cold. Once
in the King’s camp, I will sleep in a lord’s tent, and no
other. And I will have siclatouns and silks, for there
will be London and half the country to plunder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse looked solemn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They must beat Earl Simon out of the country
first,” said she; “the old watchdog keeps the meat
from being stolen. Phew, I would give something for
a loaf of bread. We shall have to bide the night here,
and chew grass. What a curse it is sometimes to wear
gay clothes, and to have no gentleman near to take one
up on his horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great contrasts were these two; Isoult, black as
midnight as to eyes and hair, sharp, peevish, slim of
body, red of mouth and white of skin; Marpasse, with
large handsome face brown as a berry, hard blue eyes
shining under a mop of tawny hair, and a mouth ready
to break into giggles. They were resting on the road,
these excellent gentlewomen, in the shelter of a sand-pit
on the hills beyond Guildford, their baggage, such as
it was, spread about them in happy confusion. Isoult
had a great slit in her poppy-red tunic, a slit that showed
the white shift beneath. She was waiting till Marpasse,
that tawny woman who loved bright colours, should
finish with the needle. But Marpasse’s darning was
slow and clumsy, and Isoult plucked grass and gnawed
it, watching the sandy track that went winding down into
the valley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse finished her botching at last, and wiping
the sand from between her toes, pulled on her stocking.
She stuck the needle into a wisp of thread, and tossed
it into Isoult’s lap. But Isoult was still gnawing grass,
and staring down the road with a brooding alertness in
her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here comes a grey goat,” she said suddenly, spitting
out a blade of grass, and wiping her chin, “maybe she
is worth being gentle to. Who knows! At all events,
we are hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse wriggled forward so that she had a view of
the road. One stout leg protruded from under the skirt
of cornflower blue, and the Juno’s limb betrayed a further
need of the needle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey, grey gull, but you are tired, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tired! Bah!” and Isoult bit her lips, “only
married women walk so, as though they had a stick laid
across their shoulders each morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse held her ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should know enough of the road, little cat,
to tell when a padder is footsore, and far spent. God
a’ me, but she is good to look at, though she be lame.
And a bag, too. If she has bread in it, I will call her
dear sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman in grey whom Isoult had sighted, came
to the mouth of the sand-pit, and saw these two wenches
in their bright clothes watching her; and when one of
them smiled and beckoned, Denise stood hesitating, and
then smiled in return. But the smile was so weary and
so sad, that Marpasse, that big woman with the head
of a sunflower, jumped up, and went out into the
road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse looked Denise over from head to foot, yet
behind the rude and bold-eyed stare there was the instinctive
good nature of a coarse, generous, vagrant
spirit. Marpasse’s self-introduction was like a friendly
slap of the hand. She spoke straight out, and did not
stop to parley.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The roads might be strawed with peppercorns in
this dry weather. It is hot in the sun too, on these
hills.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced at Denise’s feet. The shoes were dusty
and worn, with the pink toes showing. Marpasse laughed.
She was a hardy soul, and her brown feet were like
leather.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you are going to Guildford, you will not make
the town to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the road, I travelled it only a week
ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God o’ me, mistress, so do I. Come in, and
rest, we are two quiet women. And we have wine
and no bread. If you have bread, I will strike a
bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise looked from Marpasse to Isoult, that slip of
ivory swathed in flaming red. The two women puzzled
her. She had neither character nor calling to give them,
but Marpasse looked buxom, and good-tempered, and
Denise had no cause to trust people who pretended to
great godliness. Moreover she was very weary and
very footsore, and very thirsty, as Marpasse had
hinted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first thing she did was to give Marpasse the bag
she carried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is bread there,” she said, “and some
apples.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse stared, but took the bag. Isoult had crept
up, and her eyes were bright and greedy. She snatched
at the bag, but Marpasse caught her wrist, and gave
her a slap across the cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Play fair, little cat,” said she, “I cheat no one who
does not try to cheat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she turned to Denise with a laugh, her hard
eyes growing suddenly soft and bright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take your share, sister, and welcome,” she said,
“two mouthfuls of wine for a crust of your bread.
Come in. I will keep Dame Red Rose’s fingers
quiet. There are worse places to sleep in than a sand-pit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peaceable folk might have fought shy of these boldly
coloured, and bold-eyed women, but Denise had suffered
so many things at the hands of the world that she did
not stand upon dignity or caution. Marpasse and Isoult
puzzled her, being so gaudy and yet so ragged, so broad
and merry in their talk. When they had drunk wine and
broken bread together, Marpasse came and sat herself
at Denise’s feet. She unlaced the worn shoes, and finding
blood and chafed skin beneath, made a noise like a clucking
hen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not used to the road yet, my dear,” said
she, “it is time I played the barber.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her blunt and practical way she pulled off Denise’s
stockings, doing it gently enough, for the feet were
chafed and sore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Black cat, throw me the oil flask.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isoult demurred, looking a little sullenly at Denise.
For Isoult was fond of oiling and smoothing her black
hair, and there would be no oil left for the toilet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse took it by force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand these matters,” she said, “you are
a selfish brat, Isoult.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse’s broad face was so brown and kind, and
her hands so motherly, that a wet mist came into Denise’s
eyes. She was astonished that the woman should take
so much trouble, and was touched by her great gentleness.
Isoult, who was watching, saw two tears gather in Denise’s
eyes, and she started up with an angry toss of the head,
and a snap of her white teeth. Marpasse, bending over
Denise’s feet, saw those two tears fall on to Denise’s skirt.
She looked up suddenly, and for some reason showed her
roughness. Such women as Marpasse and Isoult had a
ferocious contempt for tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah, come now, no snivelling. I have not hurt you,
don’t pretend that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have not hurt me at all. It was not
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not that! Then what are you blubbering
for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not many people would have troubled about my
feet,” said Denise, almost humbly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah, many people are fools.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two women looked at each other, and Marpasse
seemed to understand. She went red under her brown
skin, laughed at herself contemptuously, and began to
drop in the oil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Black Cat has prowled away,” she said,
“and the cat is a selfish beast. Now for some cool
grass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She scrambled aside, and tearing grass from some of
the tussocks on the bank, moulded the stuff about Denise’s
feet, binding it in place with pieces of rag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will walk easier to-morrow,” she said, smiling,
“and you had better buy new hose in Guildford
town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was still smiling when Denise bent down and
kissed the coarse, laughing, good-natured mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah, if you had a beard, it might please me,” quoth
Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But from that moment she and Denise were
friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three of them slept that night in the sand-pit,
Marpasse showing Denise how she could scoop a hole in
the sand, and lie in comfort. And Denise slept till after
the dawn had broken. When she woke, the two were
packing their belongings into a sack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise felt that they had been talking about her
while she slept, for they eyed her a little curiously, but
with no cunning or distrust. Nor was Denise’s instinct
at fault. “She is not one of us,” Marpasse had said,
“not yet, at all events, poor baggage.” And Marpasse
had looked almost pityingly at Denise, for her face was
beautiful yet very sad in sleep, bathed by its auburn hair.
“She has had trouble,” Marpasse had gone on to declare;
“curses, I was more like that myself once.” Whereat
Isoult had jeered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse came over, and unbound Denise’s feet,
and in the doing of it, asked a few blunt questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe you would not be seen with us on the road?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s brown eyes answered “why?” Marpasse
looked at her and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where may you be going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time Denise’s eyes were troubled, they had no
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nowhere, and anywhere? God o’ me. I learnt that
road long ago, and a rough road it is. Come with us, if
it pleases you. I am a wise crow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise looked puzzled. She liked Marpasse, and
human sympathy was something, but she could make
nothing either of her or of Isoult, save that Isoult had
a jealous temper. They were so very gay for beggars,
nor had they the air of being upon a pilgrimage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you are for Canterbury?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse sat back on her heels, and opened her
mouth wide to laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my dear, we are not for St. Thomas’s shrine.
We are in search of service, Isoult and I. Isoult is
travelling to find service in the household of some
lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s eyes were innocent enough as she looked
at Isoult, but the girl bit her lips, and turned away.
Marpasse had mastered her laughter. On the contrary
she was studying Denise with a questioning
frown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you after St. Thomas’s blessing, my dear?”
she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise did not know how to answer her, and Marpasse,
who was wondrous quick for so big a woman, picked up
Denise’s shoes and began to lace them on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can come with us as far as you please, my
sister,” she said, “and when that body there is asleep
some time, you and I can talk together. I am called
Marpasse, and I am a very wicked woman, and the
good priests curse me, and the bad priests curse me also,
but look after me along the road. I am so wicked that
I shall certainly be claimed by the devil one day. That is
what I am, my dear; but a speckled apple is sometimes
sweet under the skin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed with a kind of fierce bravado, and Denise
saw her eyes flash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isoult broke into a sharp and malicious giggle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a good girl you were once, Marpasse!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was that,” said the elder woman, looking at
Denise’s feet; “men make, men break, and good women
prevent the mending. That is what life has been to
many.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They set out for Guildford that morning over the
blue hills where the gorse blazed, and a few solitary firs
rose black against the sky. It was a wild country, and
Denise was in wild company had she known it, for little
Isoult had had blood on the knife she carried at her
girdle, and Marpasse could use a heavy hand. They
trudged on over the heathlands, Isoult walking a little
ahead, sometimes humming a song, sometimes glancing
back sharply and impatiently at Denise. For Marpasse
took her time, remembering that Denise was footsore,
and she talked to Denise freely, telling her where she was
born, and how she had lived, and how she had come to
the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For we are beggars, my dear,” she said, “though
Madame Isoult there has a red dress. We must live,
and the good women turn up their noses. But good
women often have sharp tongues and sour faces, and
the poor men run to the mead butt and to us for
comfort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse was so frank that she could not but doubt
that Denise knew what company she was in. But Denise
had taken a liking to Marpasse, and perhaps for that
reason she did not read very clearly the truth that the
woman put honestly upon her own forehead. It
was not surprising that Marpasse should draw her
own conclusions, yet she was sorry in her heart for
Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day passed, a day of blue haze, of blue distances,
and of sunlight shimmering over purple hills. Bees were
on the wing, humming here and there amid the gorse.
At noon the women shared out the bread, wine, and apples,
and Marpasse looked at Denise’s feet. It was near evening
when they came over the last hill towards Guildford
town, with the west a pyre of peerless gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isoult, who walked ahead of the other two, turned
suddenly, and waved to them, and pointed towards the
sky line. And against the deep blue of the northern
sky they saw a line of spears moving, with here and there
the black dot of a man’s head. A banner was displayed
at the head of the company, but neither Isoult nor
Marpasse could decipher it at such a distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The line of spears went eastwards towards Guildford,
and dropped slowly out of view. Denise saw that Black
Isoult’s nostrils had dilated and that her eyes had the
glitter seen in the eyes of a beast of prey. She ran on
ahead, light on her feet as a young lad, and they saw
her stand outlined against the sky line, and then turn
and wave her arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Below, towards the valley, dark masses of men were
moving on Guildford town. The faint braying of the
trumpets came up on the evening breeze. Isoult saw
a part of the King’s host on the march.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tossed her head, laughed, and spread her arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The good saints have blessed us,” she said, and
she looked at Denise curiously under her black brows as
though searching her inmost heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse beamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our grey sister has brought us luck. We must
keep our wits sharp to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went on down the hill, and Isoult, walking
softly and lightly as a cat, pointed out where a great
baggage train lumbered with a crowd of people like
black ants about it. Already they were pitching tents
and pavilions in the meadows outside the town. The
evening sunlight seemed to strike upon water, for the
glitter of the King’s host was like the glitter of a river
flowing in the valley. Everything looked so peaceful
and minute, so orderly, and yet so human. It was like
the green grass over a quagg, bright and rich at a distance,
but covering rottenness beneath. Up on the hills one
did not smell the sweat of the horses nor hear the men’s
foul talk, nor see the savagery that was loose in their
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isoult turned, and looked sharply at Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we try the town?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse shook her head. Her face was hard now,
and her eyes watchful. Denise wondered at the change
that had come over the two women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A quick bargain is a bad one,” said Marpasse,
“let us bide our time, and listen. We are good enough
to take our choice. I shall keep my knife in my hand
to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And they went on down hill towards the camp that
was being pitched about the town.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Night came while Marpasse and Isoult were building a
fire under the lee of a grass bank in a meadow outside
Guildford, for Marpasse, shrewd woman, had no sooner
heard the din that the King’s men were making in the
town, than she had chosen to pass the night in the open
rather than within the walls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will all be drunk as swine,” she said,
“and a drunken man is no bargain. Out with your
knife, Black Cat, and run and cut some of that
furze yonder. Some lazy soul has left faggots in that
ditch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse made Denise sit down under the shelter of
the bank, for the grey sister’s feet had hurt her through
the last two miles. So Denise sat there in the dusk,
lost in a kind of vacant wonder at life, and at herself,
and at the strange way that things happened. She felt
tired, even to stupidity, and the sounds that came up
out of the town were not more audible than the roar
of a distant mill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse and Isoult made the fire, Isoult using the
flint, steel and tinder they carried with them, Marpasse
playing the part of bellows. The fire proved sulky,
perhaps because of Isoult’s temper, and her muttering
of curses. Marpasse knelt and blew till her brown cheeks
were like bladders. The flames seemed pleased by her
good-natured, strenuous face, for they shot up, and began
to lick the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse sat back suddenly on her heels, her face
very red, and shading her eyes with her hand, she looked
out into the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poof, is it the blood in my ears, or do I hear something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isoult was also on the alert, her eyes bright under a
frowning forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horses,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are they doing this time of the night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From somewhere came the dull thunder of many
horses at the trot. Nothing was distinguishable but
the fires that had been lit here and there about the
town, fires that shone like golden nails on the sable escutcheon
of the night. Isoult, who was very quick of
hearing, swore that more than a thousand horses must
be moving yonder in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curses, but it must be the rear-guard,” said Marpasse;
“God send them clear of us, or we shall be over-crowded.
The fire will save us from being trampled
on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thunder of hoofs came nearer, a sound that sent
a vague shudder through the darkness as though something
infinitely strong and infinitely savage were rushing
on out of the gloom. The earth shook. A sense of
movement grew in the outer darkness, a sense of movement
that approached like a phosphorescent wave swinging
in from a midnight sea. Then a trumpet screamed.
There was a rattling and chafing like the noise made
by the tackle of a great ship when she puts about in a
high wind. A shrill, faint voice from somewhere shouted
an order. The belated rear-guard of the host, for
such it was, halted within a furlong of the women’s
fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse shook her fist at the dark mass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fools, you should have been drunk down yonder
in the town by now! We can do very well without you.
And as likely as not you will thieve our fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isoult laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some thieves might be welcome,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Denise, who had listened to it all with tired
apathy, seemed to wake suddenly and to feel the cold,
for she shivered and drew nearer to the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite the newcomers, Isoult, Marpasse and Denise
sat round the burning wood, breaking their bread, and
listening to the shouts of the men, and the trampling
and snorting of horses. It was pitch dark beyond the
circle of light thrown by the fire, though torches
began to go to and fro like great moths with flaming
wings. Marpasse and Isoult both had their ears open.
They were rough women in the midst of rough men,
and their instincts were as fierce and keen as the instincts
of wild things that hunt or are hunted at night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Voices seemed to rise everywhere in the darkness.
A waggon went creaking by, with the cracking of a whip,
and the oaths of the driver. Mallets began to ring on
the polls of stout, ash pegs and Isoult pricked up her
ears at the sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are pitching a tent yonder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse nodded as she munched her bread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of the lords must be near,” Isoult ran on,
“we may be in good company. The saints bring us
luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes met Denise’s, and there was a startled
something in Denise’s glance that made Isoult flinch,
and then burst into spiteful laughter. Isoult had the
wine flask in her hand, and she lifted it, and drank deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blood of mine, have we an unshorn lamb here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stared at Denise impudently as though challenging
her. Denise looked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isoult’s face sharpened, the face of a little vixen ever
ready to snap and bite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, how proud we are! Coarse sluts, that is
what we are, Marpasse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big woman held up a brown hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep your claws in, cat,” she said, “you were
born quarrelling. Curse you, be quiet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Isoult obeyed, having felt the weight of Marpasse’s
fist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not long before a couple of soldiers passed close
to the fire, and seeing the three women, red, blue, and
grey, they stopped, and began to talk banteringly to
Marpasse and Isoult. The women returned the men
better than they gave, and showed them plainly that
they had no need of their company, for the fellows were
rough boors, and sweeter at a distance. Denise sat and
shuddered, huddling into herself with instinctive disgust,
and understanding why Marpasse had a naked knife
in her sleeve. The men slunk off, sending back jeers out
of the darkness, for Marpasse had shown her knife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sting of a wasp keeps such flies from buzzing
too near,” she said; “we are great ladies on occasions,
Isoult and I. We cherish our dignity for the sake of the
gold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went on with their meal, hearing movement
everywhere about them in the darkness. Isoult’s eyes
were fixed upon a fire about a hundred yards away,
whose light seemed to play upon the rose-coloured canvas
of a tent. Men were going to and fro there, and Isoult
guessed that it was some great lord’s pavilion. As for
Marpasse she ate, drank, and kept eyes and ears upon
the alert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had nothing before her but the black half
sphere of the night chequered with the yellow flutter
of the fires. Isoult and Marpasse sat facing her and
looking towards the town. Therefore they did not see
what Denise saw, the tall figure of a man in war harness,
unhelmeted, and wearing a blue surcoat blazoned over
with golden suns. He came along the bank out of the
darkness, and stood looking down at the three women
round the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Denise’s hood was back, and the firelight shining
on her hair and face. Gaillard stood on the bank above,
and stared at her, intently, silently, and she at him.
Denise felt stricken dumb, and the heart froze in her,
for Gaillard was near enough for her to recognise his face.
It seemed to Denise that he stood there and gloated
over her, opening his mouth wide to laugh, but making
no sound. She saw him raise his hand, touch his breast,
and then make the sign of the cross in the air, watching
her as a ghost might watch the confused and half-stupefied
terror of one awakened out of sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse happened to raise her eyes to Denise’s face,
and its bleak, fixed stare put her upon the alert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heart alive, sister, is the devil at my back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She twisted round in time to see a man moving off
into the darkness, and Marpasse caught a glimpse of
the gold suns on the blue surcoat. She jumped up,
looked hard at Denise, and then went a few steps after
Gaillard into the darkness. But the man did not wait
for her, and she was recalled by a sharp cry from Isoult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse saw Denise climb the bank, and disappear
into the darkness, and in a moment Marpasse was after
her, knowing more than Denise knew of a camping ground
at night. She still had view of the grey cloak, and Denise
fled like a blind thing, and like a blind thing she was
soon in trouble. She had run towards the place where
the night seemed blackest, but the passion of her flight
carried her into nothing more sympathetic than an old
thorn hedge. It was here that Marpasse came up with
her, while she was tearing her cloak free from the clinging
thorns and brambles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She caught Denise and held her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool, where are you running?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go, Marpasse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s voice was fierce and eager, the eager fierceness
of a grown woman, not the petulance of a child. She
struggled with Marpasse, but the woman kept her hold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me go, take your hands away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse found Denise stronger than she had thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool, I am holding you for your own good. Strike
me on the mouth, I am used to it. I know what a camping
ground is like at night. Some great, fat spider will
have you in a twinkling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise struggled for breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must go, Marpasse, take your hands away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Saints, don’t shout so, they are as thick here as
flies on a dead horse! Ssst, listen to that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dragged Denise close to the hedge, for they
heard men stumbling and calling in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo there, hallo!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come here, you squeakers, and keep us company.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Find ’em, good dog, find ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse laid a hand over Denise’s mouth, and they
crouched there while the men beat the hedge and shouted
like boys bird hunting with clap nets at night. They
were on the wrong side of the hedge, however, and soon
grew tired of the game. The women heard them move
off into the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse took her hand from Denise’s mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, you grey pigeon, the night hawks would
have had you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help me, Marpasse. My God, I cannot stay here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was still in a fever for flight, but more reasonable
towards Marpasse. The woman sat down under
the hedge, and pulling Denise after her, held her in her
arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me play mother,” quoth she gently, “keep
to a whisper, my dear. I know something about
trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So with the camp fires about them, and with the
sound of trumpets blown madly and at random in the
town below, these two women opened their hearts to
one another. Denise told Marpasse how Gaillard had
served her, how she had seen him that night, how she
loathed and feared the man, and Marpasse understood.
She was wise, poor wench, in the ways of the world, and
Denise’s tale might have been her own in measure. But
Marpasse had not been wholly hardened and brutalised
by the life she had led. She had the instinct of generosity
left in her, and she could be superlatively honest when
she was not rebuffed by sneers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse had an honest fit that night. She told
Denise the truth about herself, and knew by Denise’s
silence and a certain stiffening of her body that the truth
had roused a counter-shock of repulsion. Denise’s
instincts recoiled from Marpasse. The woman was
sensitive to the change. She drew aside from Denise,
and sat with her knees drawn up, and her arms clasped
over them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are like the rest of the world, sister,” she said,
with a laugh on edge with bitterness; “even when we
try to be honest, good people spit on us, and draw aside
their clothes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise stretched out a hand and touched Marpasse’s
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not that,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah, I am used to it! We are never forgiven,
and I want no forgiveness. Fawn and cringe on the
godly? To hell with their smug faces! But after all,
you and I, my dear——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stopped, and began to pull at the grass with
her hands. Denise’s eyes were shining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forgive us both, Marpasse. Sometimes
fate is stronger than we are. We are sisters, in
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse did not move. It was Denise now who
played the comforter. Marpasse did not repel her a
second time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah,” said she, “what is the use of talking? The
good people will never let me be other than I am, and
even a pig must live. But you, you can climb out of
the quagmire, my dear. The Gascon devil, I would
stick my knife in him for nothing. Listen to me now,
we must go back to the fire, and wait till the morning.
It will be easier to bolt then. You must not risk it in
the dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise still clung to the darkness, as though it
could keep Gaillard at arm’s length. Marpasse scolded
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, you chicken, you have never learnt how to
rule a man! Who is this Gaillard, indeed? I tell you
I am not afraid of him, Marpasse is a match for any
Gascon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held out her arms, and the Denise she held in
them was white-faced, and very earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a knife, Marpasse,” she said, “you can
strike me if needs be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse held her close.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, now, there, what mad things are you saying?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Denise clung to her passionately, looking straight
into Marpasse’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Promise to strike with the knife, Marpasse. Promise
or I will run, and take my chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Marpasse promised so far as the knife was concerned,
knowing that she would strike Gaillard before
she struck Denise.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>When they returned to the fire Isoult was no longer
there, but she had left some sign behind her that Marpasse
understood, for the elder woman showed no concern.
She was discreetly curt with Denise when the latter began
to wonder what had befallen Isoult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lie down and sleep, my dear,” she said, “and take
care of your feet, for you will want them on the morrow.
The black cat can see in the dark, she will come to no
harm, will Isoult.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse might as well have told Denise to love
Gaillard as to sleep. Her brain was full of a listening
wakefulness that started uneasily when a stick cracked
on the fire. So she and Marpasse kept vigil together,
while a gradual silence spread over the valley with its
armed host and its sombre town. Nor were Marpasse
and Denise disturbed that night, for the men of the rear-guard
had been marched and counter-marched that day
owing to some mad rumour, and they were dead tired,
and glad to snore under any hedge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dawn came listlessly, and without colour. The
birds were awake and singing, and with their song, bizarre
and discordant came the blowing of trumpets and the
stupid curses of the stirring men. The dawn seemed
heavy, and full of a dull discontent. Yet the birds sang,
and the men cursed perfunctorily, sulkily, the creatures
of a habit. So with the voices of the morning thrilling
from the throats of the choir invisible, the camp of the
King was one great oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was ready, and shivering to be gone. The
fire was out, her body stiff and cold, the dew heavy upon
the grass. The dawn had shown Denise how hemmed
in she and Marpasse were. Horses stood tethered everywhere,
gaunt, clumsy waggons waited like patient mammoths,
not a hundred yards away a red pavilion had been
pitched, its coloured canvas swelling and falling lazily
with the morning breeze. The babel of coarse, rough
voices that rose out of the green earth made Denise shudder
and yearn to be gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Marpasse held her ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Food and drink first,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s restless eyes betrayed her desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rest easy,” Marpasse assured her, “men are meek
in the morning, though they curse all heaven and earth.
Eat and drink, and see that your shoes sit comfortably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise ate with such hurry and such artificial greed
that Marpasse could not help but laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My teeth are not so good as yours,” she said; “if
your legs are as sound we shall not do amiss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s eyes were on the red pavilion. The flap
thereof was open, and in the black slit that clove like a
wedge into the colour, Denise thought that she saw a
man standing and looking towards where she and Marpasse
sat. Marpasse was still at her meal, when two men-at-arms
came out of the red pavilion, carrying their shields
as servers carry dishes to a table. They came over the
grass towards the women, while a man in a blue surcoat
appeared at the door of the pavilion, and stood as though
to watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise half rose, but Marpasse caught her, and pulled
her back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit still. You are far too simple.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is Gaillard, yonder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, yes. Fool him first, my dear, and then run
away when he is not looking. That is what we women
have to do when men are the stronger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two soldiers came up, and stood before Denise.
One carried food and a flask of wine in the hollow of his
shield; the other, a red scarf and a silver girdle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Messire Gaillard, our lord, yonder, begs for the
Lady Denise’s good-will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse beckoned with her arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give them here, sirs, my good will is worth
homage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men grinned, and inclined their heads with quaint
accord towards Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the grey, not the blue,” said one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise stared at the grass, and did not catch Marpasse’s
urgent nods and winks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I take no gifts from Messire Gaillard,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse made an impatient clucking with her
tongue. How prejudiced people did bungle matters, to
be sure!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think twice, my dear,” she said meaningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise repeated the same words. The men grinned,
looked at one another, and did not stir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Messire Gaillard,” said they, “has set us at your
service. It is proper that you should be guarded when
all men are not as honourable as our lord.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise saw herself trapped, and went red, and then
white. She looked at Marpasse, but Marpasse stared
obtusely into the distance, knowing that they were in
the Gascon’s hands, and that the men had been sent to
see that they did not flit. Marpasse remembered the
promise of the knife, but the morning was cold and grey,
and Marpasse too practical and hopeful to indulge in
such heroics. Therefore she put the best face she could
upon it for Denise’s sake, and Marpasse knew how to
deal with men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down, gentlemen,” said she, “I am sorry the
fire is out, but we shall be moving before long. You,
there, with the beard, since my sister is in the sulks,
I will take some of that baked meat and wine you have
brought us. Now, good health to the King, and all
soldiers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse ate and drank with relish, a second breakfast
not coming at all amiss to her, and she talked and laughed
with the men, and soon had them at her service. Denise
would touch nothing, though Marpasse smiled, nodded
and whispered in her ear. “Courage, girl,” she said,
“leave it to me, a laugh and a flash of the eyes work
marvels, even with pigs. We will spread our fingers
at them before the day is old.” But Denise sat like one
stunned, and would not believe that Marpasse meant
what she said. The red tent had a fascination for Denise,
and she saw Gaillard and two other knights come out,
sit down on cloaks their servants spread for them, and
make a meal. Then they were washed, barbered, and
armed in full view of the two women, while a boy stood
near, and sang to the sound of a lute. The whole camp
was full of stir and movement. Already, black columns
were pouring out of Guildford town. In an hour the
whole host would be on the march.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it befell that Denise found herself walking beside
Marpasse that morning at the tail of Gaillard’s company
of spears. The two men-at-arms who had been set to
guard them, walked their horses one on either side.
Marpasse trudged along, merry and insolent; Denise,
with her thoughts humbled into the dust. Gaillard
had ridden up and spoken to her, not mockingly, but
with the arrogance of a man in power. “Sanctissima,”
he had said, “before long I will find you a palfrey, and
you shall ride at my side. Hold up your head, my dear,
and be sensible; I have something on my conscience,
and by my sword, I am not unready to right a wrong.”
Denise had answered him nothing, for she was bitter
with the humiliation of it, and that Gaillard of all men
should look at her as on one whom he might graciously
lift up out of the mire. Chance had joined her to these
two women, and she guessed that Isoult’s red gown had
coloured Gaillard’s vision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they had gone a mile or more Denise asked
Marpasse in an undertone for her knife. But Marpasse
shut her mouth firmly, and shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have patience, my dear,” she said in a whisper,
“I have my trick to play. Be ready when I give the
word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Marpasse trudged on cheerfully, mocking at
herself in her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool,” she said to herself, “what is the girl to you?
Why burn your fingers pulling cinders out of the fire?
You may get kicks for it, and no money. And you may
lose your chance, too, of getting a lover. Fool! You
have had a heart of pap ever since you were born.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet though Marpasse talked to herself thus, her mind
was set on cheating Gaillard of Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King’s host went winding through the green
valleys that spring morning, marching Kentwards,
where Earl Simon had taken the town of Rochester by
assault, and pressed hard upon John de Warenne who
held out in the castle. Horse and foot, archers and
camp-followers, baggage-waggons, sumpter mules, and
loose women, made up the stream of steel and colour.
It was a rough, careless, confident march, for had not
the first triumphs fallen to the King? Northampton
had been taken, and Simon the Younger made prisoner,
with Madame Etoile, his lady. Leicester and Nottingham
had fallen, and Gifford’s seizure and destruction of
Warwick was all that the Barons could claim on their
side. The Mise had gilded Henry’s cause. Even the
King of the Scots had sent aid to his Brother of England;
a Balliol, a Bruce, and a Comyn were among his captains.
John de Warenne should keep Earl Simon under Rochester’s
walls, until the King should come and crush him,
or drive him headlong over the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Henry, weak, persuadable, false, yet brilliant gentleman,
might count himself strong that spring, with his
Poitevins and his adventurers, and the rougher lords
who preferred the licence of a weak King to the justice
of Earl Simon. But the old lion was not driven to bay
yet, much less cowed or beaten. De Montfort and
his men were not asleep, nor over confident like the
King’s party. Rochester might be many miles away,
but Earl Simon had sent some of his most trusted men
to watch the march of the King’s army, to judge its
strength, and keep him warned as to all that passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Waleran de Monceaux and Sir Aymery, woodlanders
both of them, and wise in woodland law, lay that morning
in a coppice close to the road and watched the King’s
host go by. These Sussex men were men whom De
Montfort trusted to the death. And they lay on their
bellies in the thick of the dead bracken and the brambles,
two wise dogs that saw and were not seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery was stretched at full length, his chin upon
his two fists, his grey eyes at gaze, while Waleran, more
restless and impetuous, carried on a mumbling monologue,
and chewed grass with hungry jaws. They were counting
the banners and the pennons, and marking as best they
could the lords and knights who were with the King.
Aymery lay still enough till Gaillard’s company came up,
the Gascon riding bareheaded, his blue surcoat ablaze
with its golden suns. Gaillard had found favour with
the King, despite the happenings at Pevensey, and the
anger of Peter of Savoy. Aymery knew Gaillard at
the first glance, and set his teeth hard so that the muscles
stood out about his jaw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet the tail of Gaillard’s company brought a far
fiercer inspiration, for Denise walked there beside Marpasse,
Denise with her hair of red gold shining like a
torch against the green. She walked as one going to
the ordeal of fire, white-faced, mute, looking neither to
the right hand nor left. Her grey cloak went like a cloud
beside Marpasse’s azure blue. The two men-at-arms
rode stolidly behind, while the men in the rear rank
of Gaillard’s troop were laughing and joking with Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery stiffened as he lay, and his hand went to
the sword in the dead bracken beside him. He scrambled
suddenly to his knees, with a fierce, inarticulate cry deep
down in his throat. Waleran seized him, and dragged
him back to cover, for they were so near the road that
the slightest movement might betray them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God, man, are you mad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery lay there a moment with his face on his
arms. He said nothing to Waleran, but when he raised
his head again his face was grim and full of thought.
He kept watch there in silence, but the road was empty
now save for a few camp-followers, women and beggars.
Aymery rose on one elbow, and looked towards the
drifting dust that hung on the heels of the King’s host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned suddenly to Waleran.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother, you and I must part company for a while.
Go back to our men. I must follow the march farther.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Waleran looked at him curiously out of half-closed
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know the man you are. Simon trusts us both.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They scrambled up out of their “forms,” and went
back through the wood till they came to a dell where
they had left their horses. Aymery laid his hands on
Waleran’s shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brother-in-arms,” he said, “trust me. I have a
book to read, and a debt to pay. There is nothing of
the traitor in my heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Waleran hugged him like a bear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blood of my father, I know that! I can carry
the news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They parted there, two men who loved and trusted
one another. Aymery took spear, shield, and helmet,
and mounted his horse to follow the march of the King’s
host, that splendid stream that seemed to gather and
to carry with it all the pomp and music, the violence
and passion, and the suffering sinfulness that the land
held.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A halt was called at noon, and Denise, who had walked
for four long hours, felt that hopeless weariness that
yearns only for some corner where the body may lie
relaxed. Her feet were burning, and she and Marpasse
had been trudging in the dust made by the horses, dust
that had clogged the air, and made the eyes tingle.
Denise was glad to throw herself on the grass beside
Marpasse, who was much less weary, being tougher,
and more used to the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse was very wide awake. She looked narrowly
at Denise, and rolled to the side on one elbow so as to
be nearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have our chance now, are you strong enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s dull eyes brightened, and she moistened her
lips with her tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we only had water! What can we do—here,
Marpasse, with the men all round us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse gave her the stone bottle of wine that
Gaillard had sent them that morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drink,” she said in a loud voice, “nothing like
wine on a dusty road. Heigh-ho, I shall soon be sleepy,”
and she rolled on her back so that she touched Denise,
and stretched her arms and yawned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Listen,” she said in a whisper, “there is that wood
yonder, I have my plan,” and she went on speaking
softly to Denise, and still stretching and yawning as
though there was nothing hazardous to be considered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was plodding along an endless road, with aching
feet, and gloom in her heart, that had made Denise’s
courage droop for the moment. Above all it was the
hopelessness that had tired her. Marpasse’s words were
as warm and as heartening as strong wine. The spark fell
on the tinder and red life began to run again through
Denise’s being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am strong enough, Marpasse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse seized her hand, and pretended to bite it,
like a dog at play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t look red and eager, my dear. Limp, as
though you had worn your feet to the bone. Now, good
St. George, bless all fools!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse jumped up, and crossed the road to where
the two men-at-arms who had charge of them were
making a meal. She spoke to them jauntily, her hands on
her hips, her brown face insolent and laughing, her eyes
unabashed. The men laughed in turn, and nodded.
Marpasse recrossed the road, held out a hand to Denise,
and pulled her roughly to her feet. Marpasse put an
arm about Denise, and Denise, prompted by her comrade,
limped as she walked, and leant her weight upon Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifty yards from the road was a patch of scrub that
jutted out like a pointed beard from the broad chin of
an oak wood. Marpasse and Denise went slowly towards
the trees, thinking each moment that they would hear
some voice calling them back roughly to the road. Marpasse
felt Denise straining forward instinctively upon
her arm. She was breathing rapidly like one in a
fever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They reached the scrub, and skirting it, came to the
ditch that bounded the wood. Marpasse still kept her
arm about Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gently, sister, gently; it would be a shame to
spoil everything by bolting like a hare. Be sure, our
friends behind are watching us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse turned her head to look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curses!” and the strain of the moment showed
in her impatience, “one of the fools is strolling after us.
We cannot go far with only our shadows for company.
Over! No muddy shoes this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were across the ditch, and on the edge of the
wood, Marpasse still holding Denise as they went in amid
the trees. She kept looking back till the open land and
the sky were shut out by the dense lattice work of the
boughs. The men had not followed them across the
ditch, and Marpasse blessed their luck when she saw that
the underwood had been cut that winter so that it would
be quicker running between the stubs. Only the dead
leaves troubled Marpasse, rustling and crackling under
their feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now for it, run, run!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let go of Denise, and they gathered up their
skirts and started off, scudding between the tree boles,
never stopping to look back. Denise did not feel her
feet under her. The brown leaves, the coarse grass,
and the wild flowers were like so much water over which
she seemed to skim, yet not so swiftly as her fear fled.
She was quicker than Marpasse, because her passion to
escape burnt at a greater heat. Marpasse had torn
her skirt on a stub and was panting when they came to
the farther edge of the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They paused a moment, and stood listening, and
could hear the confused hum of the host like the humming
of bees. A meadow lay before them, bounded by a
second wood that towered up the steep slope of a hill.
Against the blue a lark hung with quivering wings, and
quivering song. As they stood listening a shout rose
in the deeps of the wood behind them. Denise was off
like a deer, her whole soul quivering like the wings
of the lark overhead. Marpasse stayed a second to
pull up a stocking that had slipped to her ankle, and
then ran on after Denise across the meadow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were close to the outstanding trees of the second
wood, when Denise looked back and saw that they were
followed. The two men-at-arms who had had the guarding
of them had been too shrewd to go beating through
the trees on foot when they had begun to suspect Marpasse
of playing a trick on them. They had mounted their
horses, and ridden different ways so as to circle the wood
and gain a view of the two vixens when they took to the
open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse cursed them for their pains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Another minute, and we should have been out of
sight,” she said; “we may yet trick them in the
wood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They kept together now, labouring uphill with faces
that began to betray distress. Marpasse had a stitch
in her side, her stockings were at her ankles, and her
hair over her shoulders. They could hear the men
shouting, but paid no heed to it, for if there were but
thicker cover on the other side of the hill, they might
take to it and escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they topped the slope they heard the trampling
of horses in the valley behind them. Marpasse looked
eagerly to right and left, and an angry cry escaped her,
for a wood of great forest trees dipped gently away
from them, the trunks pillaring broad aisles that were
carpeted with sleek and brilliant sward. A man could
see through the wood as though looking along the aisles
of a church, where children could do no more than play
hide-and-seek round the piers and pillars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No luck for us! They can ride us down here almost
as well as in a meadow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise caught Marpasse’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The knife, Marpasse; give it me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse was panting, one hand at her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, not that, my dear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will not be taken alive, Marpasse. Give me the
knife, and run. They will not trouble you when they
find me here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse drew Denise behind the trunk of a great
tree, for she had seen a helmet come up over the edge
of the hill, to be followed by the tossing mane of a horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse took Denise in her arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My sister,” and she was greatly moved, “take it
not to heart. In a week, or a month, it may seem different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Denise was in earnest as her white face showed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, Marpasse, I cannot. Give me the knife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse fumbled for it, great passionate tears
rushing to her eyes. Had she not once passed through
the same pain, and shirked the crisis, only to become a
stroller and a courtesan! Denise had a more sensitive
surface, a deeper courage. Yet Marpasse’s heart cried
out against the thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men were close upon them now, riding slowly
and at some distance from one another so that the two
women should not play hide and seek behind the trees.
Marpasse turned her head away as she gave Denise the
knife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My sister, am I wrong in this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise caught her, and kissed her on the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truest of friends, go, now. It will not be so hard
to end it, for I am very tired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse broke away with a spasm of the throat.
The thought seized her suddenly that by running she
might draw the men away from Denise. Yet she had
not gone three steps before her wet eyes saw something
that made her start, and then stand like a deer at gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What Marpasse saw was a knight on a black horse
riding up furiously through the wood. He was bending
low in the saddle behind his shield, with spear feutered,
and the steel mass of his great helmet flashing in the
sunlight that sifted through the trees. His horse seemed
to gallop almost silently over the soft turf. Yet he came
on like the wind, and with no doubtful intent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse whipped round, and ran back to Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not death yet,” she said, “nor the devil either,
pray God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was the thud of hoofs on the soft turf of the
woodland rides, and the two women saw the man on
the black horse go by at the gallop, bending low
behind his shield. Marpasse stood out to watch him,
her mouth wide open as though howling a blessing.
She saw one of Gaillard’s men kicking his heels into
his horse’s flanks as though to gather speed against
the shock of that feutered spear. The knight on the
black horse was on him before the fellow could gain
much ground. Marpasse saw a spear break in the middle,
and a body go twisting over the grass like a bird with an
arrow through it, while the dead man’s horse went off
at a canter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse caught Denise by the hand, and drew her
from behind the tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glory of God, my dear,” and her eyes glistened,
but not with tears, “Lord, how I love a lusty fighter.
Here is a man who can strike a blow. And here are we
like damoiselles in a French romance, my dear. Save
us, Sir Launcelot, or Sir Tristan of Lyonnesse, whatever
your name may be! La, I could kiss you for being so
lusty!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second of Gaillard’s men had ridden in to help
his comrade. Swords were out, and sweeping in gyres
of light under the boughs of the oak trees. But he of
the black horse set about Gaillard’s man as though he
were thrashing corn. There was only one sword at
work so far as the issue was concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise looked on with dull eyes, and feverish face.
It was like a violent dream to her, those struggling
figures, and the body lying there thrust through with
the broken spear. Marpasse was dancing from foot to
foot, her brown face flushed, her eyes flashing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She threw up her arms, and shouted in triumph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has it, he has it, in the throat. Oh, brave blow!
Would I were a man, and that I had an arm like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man on the black horse had beaten Gaillard’s
fellow out of the saddle. He slid down his horse’s belly,
a dishevelled figure with limp arms and fallen sword.
One foot had caught in the stirrup, and the horse took
fright, and cantered off through the wood, dragging the
body after it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knight watched the body go sliding over the grass,
tossing its arms as though in grotesque terror. He turned
his horse, and rode back slowly towards the two women,
and they saw that he carried a hawk’s claw in gold upon
a sable shield. His surcoat was a dull green, a colour
that was not too crude and conspicuous for forest tracks.
The great helmet, with its eye cleft in the shape of a cross,
hid his face completely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse, impetuous wench, ran forward and kissed
the black muzzle of his horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lording, good luck to you,” and her blue eyes
laughed in her brown face, “never were distressed damsels
in greater need. King Arthur’s gentlemen were never
more welcome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man did not look at Marpasse, but at Denise.
She was leaning against the tree trunk, her hair hanging
about her shoulders like red light, her face a dead white
by contrast. Her brown eyes had a feverish look, and
she still held Marpasse’s knife in her right hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man on the black horse waved Marpasse aside
with his sword. And there was something about the
silent, massive figure with its iron mask that made
Marpasse move back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go yonder, and watch,” he said, pointing towards
the outskirts of the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, lording——?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go. Is my blood the blood of that dead thing
yonder!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Marpasse, who had obeyed very few people in
her life, obeyed him without a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she had gone the man put his sword up into
its scabbard, dismounted, and stood holding the bridle
of his horse. Denise’s eyes were fixed upon the helmet
with its shadowy cleft in the shape of a cross. The man
saw her bosom rising and falling, and that her eyes were
troubled. Marpasse’s knife was half hidden by the grey
folds of her gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man put both hands to the helmet, lifted it,
and let it fall upon the grass. And it was Aymery whom
Denise saw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him with wide, eloquent, and frightened
eyes, a rush of colour crimsoning her face, for Denise
remembered the Aymery of Reigate Town, the stern-faced
captain hounding Gaillard into the night. And
all the shame and ignominy that she had suffered seemed
to fall and break upon her head. She stood speechless,
her eyes looking at him like the eyes of one who expects
a blow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held out his hands to her, but she covered her
face, and leant against the trunk of the tree. Yet she
did not weep or make any sound. It was a dry, frozen
anguish with her that could neither move nor speak.
Aymery watched her as a man might watch one in bitter
pain, knowing not what to do to help or comfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps the pity in his voice stung her. God, that
it should have come to this, for she had read the truth
upon his face. Denise raised her head, and their eyes
met. Her mouth was quivering, but she looked at Aymery
as though challenging the whole world in that one man.
Perhaps Denise could not have told what made her do
the thing she did. The fever of fatalism was in her blood,
and Marpasse’s knife was in her hand. And Aymery,
stupefied, watched the red stain start out against the
grey cloth of her gown.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXXI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Denise slipped slowly to her knees, still leaning the
weight of her body against the trunk of the tree. The
languor of death seemed upon her, but her eyes could
still meet Aymery’s, brown eyes swimming with the
death mist, and growing blind to the sunlight. The
man’s shocked face, and his outstretched hands were
the last things that she remembered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, it is better so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her head drooped, her hair falling about her face.
The long lashes flickered over the eyes like the flickering
light of a taper before it dies in the darkness. Aymery
dropped on his knees beside her. He was awed, shaken
to the deeps, a man who looked upon the face of
death, and knew that the great silence was falling
upon the mouth of the woman whom he had kissed in
dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her into his arms, for there was no power
to gainsay him, and death, dread lord, still watched
and waited. They were heart to heart for the moment,
though life was melting within the span of the man’s
arms. Denise opened her eyes once, and smiled, but it
was the ghost of a smile that Aymery had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His mouth was close to hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, it is the end; do not judge me hardly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise, my desire, am I here to judge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was Gaillard’s doing,” she said, “and God
deserted me. I am very tired, so tired. Now, I am
falling asleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave a great sigh, and let her head lie upon his
shoulder, her skin growing more white under the clouding
of her hair. Aymery felt her hands grow cold as he
knelt there looking at her in a stupor of awe, and wrath,
and rebellious wonder. He believed that Denise would
open her eyes no more, that the eternal silence was
falling upon her mouth. This was death indeed, death
that found him inarticulate and helpless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He let her lie there upon the grass with her head
resting upon a mossy root of the tree, and turned to call
Marpasse back through the wood. And Marpasse came
running, to stare at the deed her knife had done, and
then to fall on her knees with a kind of blubbering fierceness,
that was combative in its grief. She laid her hand
on Denise’s bosom, and bent over her till her mouth
nearly touched the silent lips. But Denise still breathed,
and Marpasse sat back on her heels and began to unlace
Denise’s tunic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery was standing by, looking down at them as
though stunned. His helplessness maddened Marpasse,
and she turned and stung him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool, will you let her bleed to death?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had laid bare the wound in Denise’s bosom, a
narrow mouth from which the red life was ebbing
slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool! Have you such things as hands? For
God’s love, something to staunch the flow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her words were like cold water dashed into his
face. Aymery ripped his surcoat, tore a great piece
away, folded it, and gave the pad to Marpasse. She
pressed it to the wound with one hand, and with the
other beckoned Aymery to take her place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we give in without a fight?” she said, “you
are better with a sword than with a sponge, lording. I
have some linen on me, though it might have come
white out of the wash.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned up her blue gown, and tore strips from
the shift beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blood stops blood, they say,” and she ran back
between the trees to where the dead man lay with the
spear through him. The stuff and her hands were red
when she returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lift the pad, lording.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He obeyed her, and she pressed some of the linen
into the wound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bandage, what shall we do for a bandage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery tore his surcoat into strips, and knotting them
together, he gave the end to Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Raise her, gently, gently, my man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Aymery held Denise limp and still warm, with
her head and her hair upon his hauberk, Marpasse wound
and rewound the bandage about her body, drawing the
swathings as tightly as she could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she had ended it, she put her mouth to Denise’s
mouth, and felt the white throat with her fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Life yet,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she and Aymery looked into each other’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was what they asked each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Marpasse knew the country in those parts,
having lived near at one time in the house of a lord’s
verderer, and gone a-hawking, and a-hunting in the
woods. When she and Denise had started on their
flight from Gaillard and the King’s army, Marpasse
had had a certain house of Sempringham nuns in her
mind’s eye. It was a little convent hid in a valley,
aloof from the world, and very peaceful. Marpasse told
Aymery of the place. They could carry Denise there,
a forlorn venture, for both felt that she would die upon
the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Prioress is named Ursula,” said Marpasse,
“and she is a good woman, though that may be worth
little. They may know something of leech-craft.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery mounted his horse, and Marpasse lifted
Denise, and gave her into the man’s arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While the torch flickers there is light, lording,”
she said; “God grant that she may not die on the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They set off through the April woods, Aymery with
Denise lying in his arms, Marpasse walking beside the
horse, a Marpasse who was solemn and pensive, and
unlike her ribald self. Aymery hardly glanced at the
woman who walked beside the horse, for his whole soul
was with Denise, Denise so white and silent, with the
death shadows under her eyes. Her hair lay tossed in
a shining mass over Aymery’s neck and shoulder, and
he held her very gently as though afraid of stifling those
feebly drawn breaths. Sometimes he spoke to his horse,
and the beast went very softly as though understanding
Denise’s need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came out of the wood and found themselves
on the edge of a valley, a green trough threaded by a
stream running between meadows. Marpasse stood
looking about her for some familiar tree or field or the
outline of a hill. They saw smoke rising in a blue column
from a stone chimney behind a knoll of trees. Marpasse’s
eyes brightened. They had stumbled on the very place
that she sought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The luck is with us, lording,” she said, “I will
come with you as far as the gate. But a devil’s child
may not set foot on so godly and proper a threshold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke a little scornfully, and Aymery looked
down at Marpasse as though he had hardly noticed her
before. She had been a mere something that had
moved, and exclaimed, and acted. Of a sudden he
seemed to touch the humanism and the woman in
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He bent over Denise, and then looked again at Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is yet alive. How did you two come together?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse had not discovered yet why Denise had
used the knife, though Aymery had saved her from
Gaillard’s men. But Marpasse had her suspicions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We met on the road, lording, where we wastrels
drift. She was not one of us. No. She told me her
whole story. That was last night outside Guildford
Town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s eyes were on the priory beneath them
amid its meadows. He kept silence awhile, and when
he spoke he did not look at Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Part of the tale I know,” he said, “and God forgive
me, I had an innocent share in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes were on Denise’s face again, and he smiled
as a man smiles with bitter tenderness at death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me what you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse plodded along, staring at the grass. And
presently she had told Aymery all that Denise had told
her, and told it with the blunt pathos of a rough woman
telling the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were nearing the convent now with its grey
walls and trees, its barns and outhouses with their dark
hoods of thatch. Aymery’s face was grim and thoughtful.
He touched Denise’s hair with his lips, and Marpasse
saw the kiss and, being a woman, she understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil snatched at her lording,” she said, “but
God knows that she was not the devil’s, either in heart
or in body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery rode on with bowed head. He was thinking
of Gaillard, and how he would follow that man to the
end of the world, and kill him for the death he had brought
upon Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came to the convent, and Marpasse sat down
on a rough bench outside the gate. The portress was
waiting there, a very old woman with a dry, wrinkled
face, a harsh voice, and grey hairs on her chin. She screwed
up her eyes at the knight, and at the burden that he
carried in his arms. Aymery was blunt and speedy
with her, a man not to be gainsaid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace to you,” he said, “soul and body are hurt
here. Go and tell your Prioress that we are in need.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rode into the court, though a most sensitive
etiquette might have forbidden an armed man to ride
into such a place. The portress went her way with a
hobbling excitement that was very worldly. Presently
Ursula the Prioress came out, and two nuns with her
and since Aymery held out Denise to the women they
could not let him drop her upon the stones.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXXII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula the Prioress was a prim woman, a woman with
a long, thin face, and a small mouth. She had no knowledge
of life, but being very devout and religious, her
devotion and her religiosity made her conceive infallibility
within herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula had seen nothing more in Denise than a young
woman with gorgeous hair, a deathly face, and blood
upon her bosom, and Ursula’s nostrils had caught a
rank flavour of godlessness from the affair. The woman
had stabbed herself or been stabbed. She was probably
nothing more than a common courtesan, for Ursula had
a vague knowledge that the sisterhood of Rahab still
existed. And like many religious women, Ursula
was very sure of her own cleanliness, and very suspicious
of the cleanliness of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman could not be left to die, there was her
“state of sin” to be remembered; yet Ursula was
conscious of great graciousness in suffering Denise to be
carried within her doors. Then there was the knight
to be dealt with, and the Prioress who knew nothing of
men, minced before Aymery with prim haughtiness,
folding her hands over her lean body, giving him to
understand that it was no concern of hers to please him.
Aymery, in the deeps and on the heights in one and the
same hour, and stricken to the inmost humanism of
his soul, had no eyes for Ursula’s prinnickings and
prancings. He was in the throes of a tragedy, a
strong and impassioned man whose thoughts and
desires moved with the headlong naturalness of a stream
in flood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula, half eager to be rid of the man, and yet
equally curious, and prying, received him, under a hinted
protest, in her Prioress’ parlour. To be sure, she had
a couple of nuns outside the door, but some of her prejudicial
tartness vanished when she heard the name of
Simon the Earl. Even the pinpoint of the Prioress’
womanliness caught the gleam of Aymery’s intensity
that burnt at a white heat. She showed herself old-maidishly
ready to hear the truth about Denise, since
a knight trusted by Earl Simon could not be wholly a
dissolute rogue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery made a mistake that day, a mistake that
many a generous and impassioned man has made. Here
was a devout woman, a mother of souls, and Aymery
took her for what her religion should have made her.
Denise, poor child, with the flicker of life still in her,
was to be laid to rest in Ursula’s lap. No woman could
withhold pity in such a case, and Aymery told Ursula
some part of Denise’s tale, not seeing that he was throwing
a rose into a pot of sour wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prioress’ starched figure looked lean and stiff.
She was interested, but, dear St. Agnes!—greatly shocked.
Aymery’s words fell on an ass’s hide like blows on an
empty drum. The drum resounded, made some godly
stir, but held nothing more than air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery had money in his purse. It was not much,
but Ursula was a woman whose skin had the colour of
gold. She took the money, and his promises of a bequest
should the people’s cause prosper, thinking it easily
earned by burying a lost woman and putting up prayers
for her soul. Ursula would have prayed religiously.
She was perfectly sincere in her own corner of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God give rest to all sinners,” she said sententiously,
“we will do what we can for the girl. It is a pity that
she should not have been shrived.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s face would have made Marpasse weep.
It had no meaning for Madame Ursula.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would see her, before I go,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And his heart added:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps for the last time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula’s sympathy was purely perfunctory. They
had carried Denise into the little infirmary, and laid her
upon a bed. She still breathed, and two of the nuns
who had some knowledge of leech-craft, had unwound
the swathings, but feared to touch the pad that Marpasse
had forced into the wound. They had poured oil and
a decoction of astringent herbs thereon, wiped the blood-stains
from the bosom, and swathed Denise in clean linen.
Then they had given her into the hands of the saints,
and sat down to watch, whispering to each other across
the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The slant of the late sunshine came into the room
when Aymery entered at the trail of Ursula’s gown.
The sunlight struck upon the bed where Denise lay
white as a lily with the glory of her hair shining like
molten gold. And to Aymery it seemed that she smiled
sadly like one dreaming the end of some sad dream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula’s starched wimple creaked in the still room.
She stood looking down from a pinnacle of righteousness;
the two nuns rose and went to the window, taking care
to see all that passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their bodies shut off the sunlight from Denise’s
face, and threw it into shadow. Aymery was standing
beside the bed. The two nuns glanced at one another,
and were ready to titter when he knelt down in his battle
harness as though praying, or taking some vow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he rose he touched one of Denise’s hands,
and it was as cold as snow when he laid it against his lips.
Ursula made a sharp sound in her throat. Such happenings
were not discreet before women who were celibates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery rose and, looking at none of them, marched
to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If she lives,” he would have said, “be kind to her
until I can return.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But death seemed to hover so close above Denise that
he went out in silence, putting all human hope aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula followed him, debonair by reason of her
good birth, and superficially courteous after the habit
of such a gentlewoman. Would Aymery take wine
and meat? Aymery had the heart for neither, but
he remembered Marpasse. Ursula had his wallet filled
for him, and he took leave of her, finding little to say
to show his gratitude. The old portress had watered his
horse, and given the beast a few handfuls of corn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was growing dusk when Aymery rode out of the
gate, and found Marpasse still sitting there on the bench.
The figure looked lonely, with a dejected droop of the
shoulders, and a hanging of the head. Marpasse’s
worldliness was down in the dust that evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She got up from the bench and made Aymery a reverence.
A spirit of bitter mockery possessed her, for the
day’s tragedy had hurt Marpasse more than she would
confess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery reined in. He said nothing concerning
Denise, but held out the wallet that the nuns had filled
for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is food there. You must be hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse’s eyes flashed up at him, and dropped into
a hard and sidelong stare. She took the wallet, and
stood biting her lower lip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How are things, yonder?” she blurted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s fingers twisted themselves into his horse’s
mane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, a little breathing. They have put her to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no great hope——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The devil will make sure of that,” said Marpasse;
“he loves a nunnery,” and she grimaced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery walked his horse along the track, but Marpasse
did not follow him. She stood there morosely,
biting her lip, and holding Aymery’s wallet in her hands.
He glanced back, and finding that she had not moved,
he reined in again and waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse came on slowly, one hand in the wallet,
her eyes on the grass. When she had rejoined Aymery
she stopped and stood unsolicitous and silent. The
man appeared to be considering something. Yet he
saw that the woman’s face was hard and gloomy in
the twilight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are your plans?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse stared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A ditch has often served me well enough, lording.
We strollers count for little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed, fished a loaf out of the wallet, and
broke off a crust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not trouble your head about me, lording,”
she said, “go your way. One pull at the bottle, and you
shall have your wallet back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took out the flask, drank, and replaced it in the
leather bag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night to you, lording. We have our own
ways to go. Mine is a common track, and I know the
tread of my own shoes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery still held his horse in hand. He had something
to say to Marpasse, and the words did not come
to him easily. The woman was more human than
Ursula, and his heart went out to her because of Denise.
But before he had spoken twenty words, Marpasse broke
in with a rough and bitter laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lording,” said she, “you cannot make silk out of
sackcloth, however much you try. Go your way, I am
safe enough on the road. I have a bit of bread here,
and I shall sleep soundly under a bush. And to-morrow
and the next day, I shall be, just what I have been these
five years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s eyes were still troubled on her behalf.
Marpasse shook her hair, and shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mule must carry its load, and be given the
stick if it kicks, or turns aside. Bah, I know what I am!
Denise, there, that was a piece of gold to be picked up
out of the dust. Go your way, lording, and do not waste
your words. I should only laugh in your face to-morrow,
and call you a fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat down in the grass and began to eat her bread,
ignoring the man on the horse, as though that were the
surest way of answering him. There was nothing for
Aymery to do but to go, and leave Marpasse to her own
road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God’s speed, lording,” she said as he turned his
horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God’s speed to you, sister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that would be too slow for me, sir!” and her
laughter rang out with forced audacity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the night came, and these two solitary ones took
up the strands of their several lives, strands that had
been tangled by the martyrdom of Denise. Earl Simon’s
trumpets called Aymery into the east, whither the King’s
host went marching with dust and din. No sword
could stay in the scabbard those days, and Aymery had
pledged his to Earl Simon, who needed every sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse had watched Aymery ride away into the
gathering darkness. She sat there in the grass, sullen,
brooding, yet touched by what he had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah!” said she, “what would be the use? Brave
heart, go your way, and God bless you, for being brave,
and honest. Wake up, fool! What, thick in the throat,
and ready to blubber like a sot in his cups! Marpasse,
my dear, you are a slut and a fool! This is what comes
of letting your heart run away with your heels. You
will be back to-morrow on the old devil-may-care road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for all her self-scorn—Marpasse could not conjure
her own emotion. Her heart hurt her and was troubled,
nor could she sleep that night, though she huddled close
under the forlorn remnant of a haystack that she found
in a meadow. Marpasse felt alone, utterly alone in
the world, and conscious of the raw night and the darkness.
Who would have cared, she thought, if she had
used her knife as Denise had used it? Strangers would
have kicked her into a hole, and covered her with sods;
that would have been the end.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXXIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Rochester city had been stormed on the vigil of Good
Friday, but De Warenne still held the castle, and two
great Sussex lords, William de Braose of Bramber, and
John Fitzallan of Arundel were with him. They knew
that the King was on the march; nor was Earl Simon to
remain much longer before the walls, for Henry forced
him to raise the siege by threatening London with his
host. It was Waleran de Monceaux who brought the
news of the King’s march, and Aymery, who rode into
Rochester but a day behind his brother-in-arms, found
De Montfort preparing for a retreat. Their spears were
rolling on London when the next dawn came up behind
the great tower of the castle, for London was the heart
of England that year, and a sudden stab from the King’s
sword might have let the life-blood out of the cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Earl Simon and the Barons’ men marched through
Kent, and pushed in between the King’s host and the
city. The Londoners rang their bells, and came shouting
over the bridge to bring the Great Earl in. The burghers
had been busy since the rejection of King Louis’ award.
They had imprisoned some of the King’s creatures on
whom they had been able to lay their hands, and sacked
and devastated the royalist lands in Surrey and Kent.
The week before Palm Sunday the Jewry had been
stormed, its inmates massacred, and great treasure
taken. London had pledged itself in blood, and De
Montfort tarried there, waiting for men to gather to
him from the four quarters of the land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the roads smoked with these marchings and
counter-marchings, and while spears shone on the hill-tops,
and steel trickled through the green, Denise cheated
death in that quiet valley amid the Surrey hills. Marpasse’s
knife had turned between the ribs, missed the
heart by the breadth of a finger nail, and let Denise’s
blood flow, but not her life. Marpasse’s rough sense
had saved her, Marpasse who had saved the body, while
Aymery had been busy with the soul. And yet to the
nuns Denise’s return out of the valley of the shadows had
seemed nothing short of a miracle. Ursula, true to her
belief, had seized the first glimmer of consciousness
and sent for the priest who served the convent as confessor.
But Denise had put the good man off, pleading
that she would not die, and that she was too weak to
tell him so long a tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first few days Denise lay in her bed, very white
and very silent, taking the wine and food they brought
her, and speaking hardly a word. She was like one half
awakened from sleep, able to feel and think, but with
the languor of sleep still on her. She felt that it was
good to lie there in peace, aloof from the world, with
the quiet figures gliding in and out, and the sunlight
moving in a golden beam with the floor of the little room
for a dial. The ringing of the convent bells came to
her, and the singing of the nuns in the chapel. Denise
lay very still through the long hours in a haze of dreamy
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How much did she remember? Enough to inspire
her with a new desire to live, enough to make her realise
how mad had been the impulse that had set Marpasse’s
knife a-flashing. They seemed so far away, and yet so
near and intimate, those happenings in the April woodland.
In moments of deep passion the human heart
seizes on what is vital and utterly true, even as those
who are dying sometimes seem to see beyond the bounds
of the material earth. So Denise remembered that which
a woman’s heart would choose to cherish. It had been
no mere golden mist of pity glazing the cold truth. She
had lain in Aymery’s arms, arms that had held her with
something stronger than compassion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus as Denise lay there abed, a slow, sweet faith
revived within her, a belief in things that had seemed dry
and dead. Her woman’s pride had been in the dust,
and she had given up hope, save the hope of hiding in
some far place. It might have been that Aymery’s arms
had closed an inward wound, and that the strength of
his manhood had given her new life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What had the “afterwards” been? What had
happened after she had lost consciousness, and what
had become of Aymery and Marpasse. She longed to
ask the nuns these things, and yet a sensitive pride tied
her tongue. The women were kind to her, and yet, as
Denise’s consciousness became more clear, she could not
but feel that the eyes that looked at her were inquisitive
and watchful. Now and again came a note of pitying
tolerance that jarred the rhythm of her more sacred
thoughts; and as the woman in her grew more wakeful
she became aware of the shadows that stole across her
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the third day the nuns unswathed her body, soaked
the clotted pad away, and looked at the wound. It was
healing miraculously with nothing but a blush of redness
about its lips. There had been no fever, no inward
bleeding. Denise could sit up while they reswathed her
in clean linen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is cause for thankfulness here,” said the
elder of the two nuns who had the nursing of her; “you
will have many prayers to say, and many candles to
burn to Our Lady and the Queen Helena, our Saint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke with brisk patronage, but Denise took it
for the spirit of motherliness in the woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I owe you also a debt,” she said, looking up into
the nun’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sister licked her lips as she smoothed the linen
about Denise’s breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man and the horse are also to be remembered,”
she said, a little tartly, “you have much to be thankful
for; even I can tell you that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sharpness in her voice, and a certain
insinuating and inquisitive look on her face that made
Denise colour. The woman was watching her out of the
corners of her eyes, as though she were quite ready to
listen if she could persuade Denise to talk. Minds that are
cooped up in sexless isolation are often afflicted with morbid
imaginings, and an unhealthy curiosity with regard
to the more human world. The monastic folk were prone
to a disease that they called “accidia.” The life was
very dull, very narrow, and led to introspection. What
wonder that a woman should sometimes hanker to dip
her spoon into the world’s pot, and smell the stew, though
she was not suffered to taste it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was thankful, and at peace, but she had no
desire to open her heart like a French tale for these
women to pore over. The nun won no confession from
her, and therefore thought the worse of Denise’s soul.
People who were silent had much to conceal, and the
religious sometimes prefer a vivid and garrulous sinner
to one who cherishes a reserve of pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two nuns were but mead and water when compared
with their Prioress, who was sharp and biting
wine. The miraculous swiftness with which Denise
had been healed flattered St. Helena, and the piety of
her convent. Ursula the Prioress was an earnest woman,
cold, bigoted, well satisfied with her own spirit of inspiration.
She began to see in Denise a brand to be
snatched from the eternal fire, a soul to be humbled and
chastened, and purified of its sin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the fifth day of Denise’s sojourn there, one of
the nuns bent over her, and told her in an impressive
whisper that the Prioress was coming to sit beside her
bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be very meek with her, my dear,” said the nun,
“and if she speaks sharply to you, remember that it is
for the good of your soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Ursula came, white wimple about yellow face,
severe, admonitory, stooping very stiffly towards the
level of this mere woman. She sat down on the stool
beside Denise’s bed, and began at once to catechise her
as she would have catechised a forward child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise went scarlet at the first question. It was
flashed upon her without delicacy that Ursula knew
her secret, and that either Aymery or Marpasse had told
her something of what they knew. And Denise’s pride
was not so frail and weak that she could suffer Ursula to
take her heart and handle it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” she said, “I have much to thank you for.
Yet I would ask you not to speak of what is past. Being
wise in the matter, you will know what my thoughts
must be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula was not to be repulsed in such easy fashion,
for she knew a part of Denise’s tale, and had decided in
her own mind that Aymery had treated the subject with
too much chivalry. Compassion had softened the harsher
outlines, and Ursula had no doubt that Denise was less
innocent than she may have pretended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My daughter,” said she, “for the good of your
soul, I cannot let such things pass unheeded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise lay motionless, staring at the timbers of the
roof. Ursula talked on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our Mother in Heaven knows that we are frail
creatures, and that sin is in the world, but it is the hiding
of sin that brings us into perdition. It is meet for your
penitence that I should speak to you of these infirmities.
There is no shame so great that it may not be retrieved.
But you must own your sin, my daughter, and humble
yourself before Heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s hands moved restlessly over the coverlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have confessed it,” she said, “though it was not
of my own seeking. God himself cannot condemn that
as a lie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula’s face grew more austere and forbidding.
She detected hardness and obstinacy in Denise, and
overlooked that sensitive pride that may seem reticent
and cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You speak too boastfully,” she said. “It may
be that God wills it that I should bring you to humbleness
and a sense of shame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the truth, that I have suffered,” said Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet perhaps, have you suffered sufficiently, for
the proper chastening of the spirit. Think, girl, of God’s
great goodness, and the compassion of Our Mother, and
St. Helena, in snatching you from death, and the flames,
you—one who had fallen, a broken vessel by the roadside,
the companion of low women——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Denise’s face flashed scarlet, but this time there
was anger in the colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” she said, “hard words do not bring us
into Heaven. I have never been what you would have
me pretend to be. And the woman, Marpasse, stood by
me, and was my friend. She has a good heart, and for
me, that covers a multitude of sins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula, cold fool, was instantly affronted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What!” and she seemed to smack her lips with
unction, “you, who have worn the scarlet, speak thus
insolently to me! It is plain that you have no sense of
shame. Hard words indeed are what you need, young
woman, the bread of bitterness and the waters of affliction.
Pity for your soul moves me to speak the
truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flush had faded from Denise’s face. She lay
there very pale and still, as though suffering Ursula’s
harsh words to pass over her like the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is it, madame,” she said at last, “that you
believe so much that is bad of me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula had her answer ready, the answer such a
woman was destined to produce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Earl Simon’s knight warned me, as was but right
and honest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aymery!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Aymery, would be more fitting. It was he
who besought me to take you in, knowing your misery,
and the madness that sin must create in the mind. Pray
to God that he may be blessed for snatching you from
the devil, and for bringing you here, where, Heaven being
willing, we will humble and chasten you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise lay there as though Ursula had taken Marpasse’s
knife and stricken her, this time to the heart.
She had nothing to say to the Prioress. The woman’s
hard morality had broken and bruised her re-born pride
and hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula rose, and stood beside the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let the knowledge of sin and of humiliation sink
into your heart,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And never did woman speak truer or more brutal
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Ursula had gone, Denise lay in a kind of
stupor, mute, wondering, like one who has been
wounded and knows not why. All her dreams were
in the dust. Ursula, the iconoclast, had broken the
frail images of tenderness, mystery, and compassion.
Aymery had said this of her? Denise had no strength
for the moment to believe it otherwise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so she lay there, humiliated indeed, very lonely,
and without hope. There was no bitterness in her at
first, for the shock that had destroyed her vision of a
new world, had left her weak and weary. She thought
of Aymery with pitiful yearning and wounded wonder,
and with the wish that he had suffered her to die. Marpasse
alone might have comforted Denise in that hour
of her defeat.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXXIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Denise soon found that the frost of Ursula’s displeasure
had fallen on her, and that she was to be humiliated and
chilled into a proper state of penitence. The temper of
the nuns changed to her; they came and went without
speaking, their impassive faces making her feel like a
child that is in disgrace. It was Ursula’s wish that
Denise should be mortified in soul and body. Her food
and drink were water and bread, and lest the devil of
comfort should remain to tempt her to be obstinate,
they took the straw and sheets from the bed, and let
her lie upon the boards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moral frost at such a season was like a severe night
in the late spring. Denise’s need was to lie in the sun,
and to be smiled upon by kind eyes. It was the warm
humanism of life that she needed, sympathy, and a
clasp of the hand. The utter injustice of the humiliation
that they thrust upon her began to awake in her a spirit
of revolt. Had she not suffered because of her innocence,
and borne what these women had never had to bear?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why should she fall at Ursula’s feet, and pretend to
a penitence that she did not feel? And Aymery, too,
was she to believe that he had spoken as Ursula had
said? If that was the truth, and why should Ursula
lie, she, Denise, would pray that she should never be
driven to look upon his face again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet her bodily strength increased despite her spiritual
unhappiness. The wound in the breast had healed, and
she had been able to leave her bed, and move slowly
round the room, steadying herself against the wall.
And as her strength increased the instinct of revolt grew
in her till she began to understand the mocking spirit
of Marpasse. To be reviled, humiliated, made to crawl
in the dust, to regain a little grudging respect by cringing
to her sister women, and by pretending to emotions that
she did not feel! These good souls seemed set upon
making the re-ascent to cleanliness hard and unlovely.
And Denise, like Marpasse, felt a passionate impatience
carrying her away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Ursula, magnanimous lady, had taken
pains to spread Denise’s story through the convent, and
the two nuns who had nursed her had been women
enough to know that Denise had borne a child. Ursula
had issued her commands; the contumacious devil
was to be driven out of Denise; she was to be humbled,
and taught to pray for penitence and grace. The nuns
who served Denise now opened their mouths once more,
and became oracles whose inspiration had been caught
from Ursula’s lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One would enter with the water-jar, set it under the
window, and retreat without so much as glancing at
Denise. She would pause at the door, and let fall some
pious platitude that might act like yeast upon the perverse
one’s apathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Flames of fire shall subdue those who are stubborn
in sin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While the vile flesh lives, the soul is in peril. Mortify
the body therefore, that the soul may be saved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A proud heart means death. Let your pride be
trampled under your feet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Live, repent, and sin no more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such exhortations spaced out Denise’s day, but her
obstinacy and her bitterness of heart increased till she
was nauseated by their piety, and filled with a gradual
scorn. Twice Ursula visited her, to depart with the
impatience of one whose words were wasted. Had
Ursula suffered but once in life, it might have been so
humanly simple for her to understand Denise. On the
contrary, she found the victim less ductile than at first.
Nearly three weeks had passed, and Ursula decided that
the woman was well in body, but utterly diseased in
heart. The Prioress began to bethink herself of sharper
measures. Ursula believed that she had the devil in
arms against her, and that the battle was for Denise’s
soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the night of May-day, the day of green boughs
and garlands, and Denise had stood at her window and
watched the sun go down, thinking of the May a year
ago, and of her cell in the beech wood above Goldspur
manor. The sun had set about an hour when Denise
heard footsteps in the gallery, and saw the light of a
lamp shining under the door. Ursula came in to the
dusk of the room, shielding the lamp from the draught
with the hollow of her hand. Her austere face was
hard and white, and from one wrist hung a scourge set
with burs of wire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula had brought two of her strongest nuns with
her. She set the lamp on a sconce, and was as abrupt
and practical as any pedagogue. She bade the women
close the door, and commanded Denise to strip and
stand naked for a scourging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since words will not move the evil spirit in you,”
she said, “we must try sharper measures.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise put her back against the wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have a care how you touch me. I am not a dog
to be whipped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula told the two nuns to take her by force, and
to strip her of her clothes. But Denise was no longer
the patient saint bowing her head before her destiny.
She did what Marpasse would have done in such a storm,
and taking the water-jar that stood by her, held Ursula
and the nuns at bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Off!” she said, “I have some pride left in me.
I have eaten your bread, but I will not bear your blows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was so tall and fierce, and untamable, that
Ursula was the more convinced that Denise had a devil
in her, and a devil that was not to be treated with disrespect.
She called the nuns off, not relishing an unseemly
scuffle, and having some reverence for a stone
water-pot that was not to be softened by formulæ. It
would be easier to catch Denise asleep, tie her wrists,
and scourge her till she showed some penitence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Woman,” she said, “the evil spirit is very strong
in you. But God and my Saint helping me, I will subdue
it in due season.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Ursula, whose piety was given to stumbling
rather ridiculously over the hem of her own gown, had
no second chance of scourging the devil out of Denise.
For Denise had suffered St. Helena’s hospitality sufficiently,
and she made her escape that night after losing
herself in dark passage-ways and listening at doors which
she hardly dared to open. She made her way into the
court at last, and found the old portress sleeping in her
cell beside the gate. The key hung on a nail behind the
door, and Denise, who had brought a lighted taper that
she had found burning in the chapel, took the key and
let herself out into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had made her escape not long before dawn,
choosing the time when she knew that the nuns would
be in their cells between the chapel services. She waited
for the grey dusk of the coming day, sitting under an
oak tree on the hill above the convent. And when the
birds awoke and set the woodlands thrilling, Denise sat
counting the last of the money Abbot Reginald had
thrown down at her that winter night, and which Marpasse
had sewn up for her in her tunic. Denise thought of
Marpasse as she broke the threads and counted out
the money into her lap, for Marpasse seemed the one
human thing in the wide world that morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Life stirred everywhere when Denise started on
her way with half a loaf, some beggarly coins, and her
old clothes for worldly gear. Brown things darted and
rustled in the underwood and grass. A herd of deer
went by in the dimness of the dawn, and melted like
magic shapes into the woodland as the great globe of
fire came topping the eastern hills. The light fell on a
dewy world, a world of well-woven tapestry dyed with
diverse and rich colours. And Denise saw bluebells
in the woods, and thought again of Marpasse and her
blue gown. Marpasse would understand. She tried
not to think of Aymery that morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise struck a track that came from nowhere, and
led nowhere so far as she was concerned. She went on
aimlessly till noon, meeting a few peasant folk who took
her for a pilgrim or a beggar. And by noon her body
that had lain so many days in bed, cried loudly for a
truce under the May sun, and Denise, finding a pool by
the roadside, knelt down there and drank water from her
palms. The sun had dried the grass, and lying at full
length she was soon asleep, with the brown bread held
in one white hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bank hid Denise from anyone who passed along
the road, and a knight on a black horse came by as she
slept. The sound of his horse’s hoofs woke Denise.
She raised herself upon one elbow, looked over the bank
to see who passed, and then sank down again out of
sight. The clatter of hoofs died in the distance, but
Denise lay there and stared at the clouds in the sky.
It was Aymery who had ridden past to hear from Ursula
of Denise’s life or death. But Denise let him go, hardening
her heart against the thought of any man’s pity.
She would not be beholden to Aymery after the words
that Ursula had spoken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the Knight of the Hawk’s Claw came to the convent
that day in May, hardening himself against all possible
hope, and prepared to hear nothing but the tale of Denise’s
death. Ursula received him in her parlour, Ursula who
had set her final condemnation upon Denise because of
the perversity and ingratitude she had shown in escaping
like a thief in the night. And Ursula cursed Denise before
Aymery’s face, pouring out her indignation against the
woman, as though Aymery would sympathise with her
over Denise’s “contumacy and corruption.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula had no eyes to see the change that had come
over the face of the man before her. She was so busy
with her denunciations that she did not mark the
wrath rising like a cloud on the horizon. Aymery’s
silence may have deceived her, for he heard her to
the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked hard at Ursula, and the gleam in his eyes
would have made a less confident woman wince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you thought that she needed scourging!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula was very dense that day, refusing to see what
a tangle she was weaving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The scourge is an excellent weapon, messire,” she
babbled, “my own back has borne it often, and to the
betterment of my soul. But this girl had no gratitude,
and no sense of shame. She was obstinately blind,
and would not see. I sought to move her by forcing
your compassion upon her, and showing her that it was
your desire that she should mend her life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery looked at Ursula as though tempted to strangle
the consequential voice in that thin, austere throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told her that, madame!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I held her shame before her eyes, for the tale of her
innocence was not to be believed. Her whole character
contradicted it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she has fled from you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With ingratitude, and cunning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before God, I do not blame her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood motionless a moment, looking down on
Ursula with such fierce contempt, that, like many stupid
people, she wondered how the offence had risen. Her
eyes dilated when Aymery drew his sword. Her mouth
opened to call the nuns who waited in the passage, but
his laugh reassured her, the laugh that a man bestows
on a thing beneath his strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said, “you have nothing to fear from
me but the truth. You see this sword of mine”—and
he held the hilt towards her, grasping it by the blade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula stared at him as a timid gentlewoman might
stare at a rat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That hilt is in the form of a cross, madame; I
would beg you to look at it. You may have heard that
the Cross has some significance for Christians.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula began to recover her dignity. It was borne
in upon her suddenly that this man had stern eyes, and
an ironical, mocking mouth. And Ursula began to
dislike those eyes of his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your words are beyond me, messire,” and her
normal frostiness struggled to pervade the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery looked at her as a man might look at something
that was very repulsive and very ugly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame,” he said quietly, “if you have slain a soul,
God forgive you; there are so many fools in the world,
and so many of them are godly. There was no sin in
Denise that called for the sponge full of vinegar, the
scourge, and the spear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ursula opened her mouth, but no sound came.
Aymery put up his sword, and turned towards the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would rather have left her,” he said, “in the
hands of the woman you have called an harlot. Nor
need your zeal have put lies into my mouth. Suffer me,
madame, to recommend you a saint. St. Magdalene
might give you the religion that you lack.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he went out from her, leaving Ursula speechless,
and amazed at his insolence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Aymery’s wrath was a greater and nobler wrath
than Ursula’s as he mounted his horse and rode out into
the world, that world for which Christ had bled upon the
cross. Bitterly plain to him was Denise’s spirit of revolt,
and her passionate discontent with Ursula’s morality.
What was more, this woman had put her taunts and her
homilies into his mouth, and made him harangue and
edify Denise! Aymery cursed Ursula for a meddlesome,
cold, and self-righteous fool. He would rather have
left Denise in Marpasse’s hands, for Marpasse had a heart,
and no belief in her own great godliness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Denise, what would befall her now that they
had driven her like an outcast into the world? He
was gloomy and troubled because of her, feeling that she
had been wounded the more deeply than she had ever
been wounded by Marpasse’s knife. He remembered
too how Denise had sought death in the woods that day.
The impulse now might be more powerful, seeing that
she had suffered more, and had no friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ride after her into the blind chance of the unknown
he could not yet, for Aymery was pledged to Earl Simon
and his brethren-in-arms. The Barons’ host had gathered
at London; they were on the eve of marching southwards
into Sussex, for the King was threatening the Cinque
Port towns which were loyal to Earl Simon. Aymery
had seized these two days to ride and discover the truth
about Denise. His knighthood was pledged to the
man who had knighted him, nor could he break the pledge
to chase a wandering shadow.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXXV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse of the blue gown had fallen in with old friends
on the way to Tonbridge, where the King had taken the
castle of Gilbert de Clare, and these same friends, ragamuffins
all of them, were following the glittering chaos
of the King’s host on the road to the sea. There would
be plunder to be had if St. Nicholas would only persuade
King Henry to take and sack the Cinque Port towns;
and all the beggars, cut-throats and strollers in the kingdom
rolled in the wash of the King’s host, terribly joyful
over the happenings that might give them bones to
pick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The passing of fifty thousand armed men, to say
nothing of the baggage rabble, was no blessing to the
country folk whom it concerned. Lords, knights, men-at-arms,
bowmen, scullions, horse-boys, and harlots
went pouring southwards in the May sunshine, ready to
thieve whatever came to hand. King Paunch ruled the
multitude, for the host ate up the land, and called like
a hungry rookery “more, more!” And since a hungry
mob is an ill-tempered one when once its patience has
leaked out of its tired toes, the King’s followers began to
grow very rough and cruel before they had marched
five leagues. Hunger does not stand on ceremony, and
such brutal things were done that the country folk took
to the woods and swore death to any straggler. Bludgeon,
and axe, and bow took toll of the King’s host, and many
a rowdy was caught and left grinning at the heavens,
with his stiff toes in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Marpasse and her friends were as hungry as
the rest, and coming as they did, like fowls late for feeding
time, their genius for theft was developed by necessity.
Yet it is not so easy to steal when everything eatable has
been stolen, and when a crossbow bolt may come burring
from behind a wood-stack. None the less, Marpasse and
her company were in luck not ten miles from Tonbridge
Town. They saw a sow feeding on the edge of a beech
wood close to the road. There was much pannage in the
neighbourhood, and Marpasse and her comrades tucked
up their skirts, and went a-hunting, and were blessed
with the sight of the black backs of a whole drove of
swine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Great and grotesque was the joy that hounded and
hunted through the beech wood, a mob of men-at-arms,
beggars, boys, and women trampling the bluebells and
the brown and crackling bracken. They shouted, laughed,
and cursed as they rounded up the swine, and chased them
hither and thither amid the trees. God Pan and his
minions went tumbling over tree roots after the black
beasts that bolted, and squealed, and flickered like
grotesque shadows under the boughs of the beeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse, her skirts tucked up, and her knife flashing,
shouted and ran with the lustiest till the sweat rolled
into her eyes. As she stood to get her breath, a fat sow
came labouring by with a young pig close to her haunches.
Chasing them came a long, loose-limbed boy, his hair
over his face, his mouth a-gape, his thin legs bounding,
striding, and ripping through the bracken. He came up
with the chase close to Marpasse, and threw himself on
the young porker as a leopard might leap upon a deer.
Brown boy and black hog rolled in a tangle into a clump
of rotting bracken, and Marpasse, holding her sides,
laughed at the tussle, and then ran on after the sow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sow, grunting and labouring, led Marpasse away
from the rout, and back towards the road. Marpasse,
intent on bringing the dame to book for supper, ran on
till she came suddenly into a glade with a slant of sunshine
pouring through it, and the open land and the
road showing at one end thereof. Marpasse followed
the sow no farther, for she had stumbled on another
adventure that showed more importunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse saw a woman in grey leaning against the
trunk of a tree. Not ten paces from her stood an old
black boar, with the broken shaft of a spear protruding
from one shoulder, and a broad trickle of blood running
down his left fore-leg into the grass. The beast tottered
as he stood, swinging his head from side to side, his little
eyes malevolent, his wiry tail twisting with savage spite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse gave a whistle, and looked like one who
has run against a ghost. She saw the boar make a dash
at Denise, Denise, who was playing hide-and-seek for
her life with him round the tree. The beast missed her,
and came to earth, only to struggle up, lurch round, and
charge once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse clutched her knife, and made a dash for
the tree. The boar had missed his blow again, and stood,
resting, still dangerous despite the spear head in his side.
Marpasse gained the tree with its roots clawing the soil.
She gasped out a few words to Denise like a breathless
swimmer joining a comrade on a rock in the thick of a
boiling sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May marvels never cease! You, child, you, as I
shall live to kill pigs! Lord, now, keep an eye on this
limb of a black satan!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She peered round the tree trunk, and pushed Denise
round it as the boar charged again, white tusks showing,
snout bloody, his little eyes like two live coals. He
swerved and missed Marpasse, but she was on him before
he could recover and turn. The knife went home where
six inches of steel might reach the heart, and Marpasse,
springing aside to escape the mad side slash of the tusks,
saw that the gentleman had the <span class='it'>coup de grâce</span>. He rolled
over, struggled up again on his belly, scraped the earth
with his fore trotters, and then wallowed amid the beech
leaves. Marpasse sat down at the foot of the tree,
panting and laughing, her brown face red and healthy.
She threw the knife aside, caught Denise by the skirt,
and pulled her down lovingly into her lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God alive,” she gasped, “what a girl it is! Am I
always to be rescuing you from Gascons, and from
pigs?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse was quite joyous. She kissed Denise on
the mouth, and then held her away from her, and looked
at her with blue eyes that shone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heart of mine, is it you in the flesh, my dear?
Why, we left you for dead, Sir Aymery and I! And
mightily gloomy he was too, poor lording. To think of
it, that I should fall on you in the middle of a wood,
while I was chasing an old sow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though she was very voluble, Marpasse’s eyes were
scanning Denise as one looks at a friend after a long
sickness. Marpasse’s eyes were very quick. She could
have told the number of wrinkles on Denise’s face, had
there been any. But Marpasse saw something there
much more sinister than wrinkles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sister,” said she, “here is indeed a miracle.
But I am not so strong as the lord on the black horse,
so please to sit on the grass and let me get my breath.
Now for the story. How did St. Helena and all the saints
heal you, and how do you come to be here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise slipped aside from Marpasse, and sat down
at the foot of the tree. It was a hard, brooding look
about her eyes that had struck Marpasse. Things had
not gone with pious facility. Marpasse could tell that
by Denise’s silence, and by the half-sullen expression
of her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your knife turned between my ribs, Marpasse,”
she said, “I was a fool to bungle so easy a stroke; I had
only to lie still, eat and sleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse clapped her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is gratitude, and I swaddled you up like a
baby! How is it that you are not still lying abed, and
eating and sleeping? You look thin, eh, and what does
Sir Black Horse know about it all? Lord, but what
a lot of running away you have done in your life! So
you fell out with the pious folk, was that it? I could
never abide the smell of a nun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She pinched Denise’s cheek, watching her narrowly,
for Marpasse had learnt to use her wits, and the philosophy
that she had learnt upon the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my dear, what happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ran away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a soldier you would make! Madame Ursula
was too good a woman. They are all too good for us,
my dear; that is where the mischief comes, they tread
on us, and expect us to be meek and grateful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse grew serious and intent. She looked
steadily at Denise, and then reached out and caught
her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more jesting,” she said, “look in my face,
sister. I have learnt to read a face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held both Denise’s hands, and drew her a little
towards her. For a moment they were silent. Then
Marpasse pressed Denise’s hands, sighed, and allowed
herself a bluff round oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curse them,” she said, “curse their godliness. So
you told them the whole tale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise hung her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Messire Aymery told Ursula.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fool! Too much in love to be wise, I warrant.
Come now, my dear, love is great of heart, but love is
blind, and love talks when it should shut its mouth.
Show me the way out of the wood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew Denise close to her, so that her head was
on her shoulder. Yet for the moment Denise seemed
cold and mute. Marpasse kissed her on the mouth, and
the one woman’s lips unsealed the other’s soul. Before
long Marpasse had drawn the whole tale from her, and
Marpasse looked fierce over it, and yet more fierce when
Denise betrayed the bitterness that had poisoned her
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God in Heaven, child,” she broke in suddenly,
“do you know what you are saying?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know what you are, Marpasse. They were ready
to whip me; I had no pity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse set her teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This life, the devil pity you! For me, yes, but
you! I have a brazen face, a conscience like leather,
and talons that can tear. But you! Bah, you would
kill yourself in a month.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thrust Denise away from her, as though thrusting
her from some influence that was dangerous and to be
feared. Denise did not resist her, but sat hanging her
head, mute and obstinate, her eyes sweeping up now
and again to the face of the woman beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am weary of it all,” she said, “they made the soul
sick and bitter in me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse sat with her chin on her fists, her forehead
one great frown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ssh, and you thought of me, and the road!
Am I such a damned witch as that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do not curse, and preach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse turned on her with sudden, fierce sincerity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do not preach, because I am down in the
ditch, but I know what the mud is like, and I do not
want you with me. Bah, let me think. What shall
I tell you, that you had better be as dead as the black
boar there, before you take to the road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse hugged her knees with her arms, staring
straight before her, and working her teeth against her
lower lip. Denise kept silence, hanging her head, and
flying in the face of her own bitterness like a bird that
dashes itself against a window at night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse awoke suddenly from her musings, and
caught Denise by the hood of her cloak. She twisted her
hand into the grey cloth, held Denise at arm’s length,
and threw one word straight into her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s eyes flashed. She reddened from throat
to forehead, while Marpasse watched her as a physician
might watch the workings of some violent drug. Presently
the brown eyes faltered, and grew clouded with
the infinite consciousness of self. Marpasse burst into
a loud, harsh laugh. The next moment she had her
arms about Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soft fool, the word stings, eh? You are innocent
enough; it is all temper, and anger and discontent.
Your conscience answered to the sting. I throw your
own word in your face, and you redden like an Agnes.
No, no, you are not made to be one of us, thank God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise felt this big woman’s brown arms tightly
about her. A great spasm of emotion had gathered in
Marpasse’s throat. She held Denise with a straining,
inarticulate tenderness, as a mother might hold a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heart of mine,” said she, “God forgive me for throwing
that word in your face. It was the slap of a wet cloth
on the cheek of one about to faint. Look up, sister,
listen to me, by the Holy Blood, I have the truth to
tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse was trembling with the passion in her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take my knife again, Denise, before that! Do
I not know, stroller and slut that I am! No, no, not
that, not the dregs of other folks’ cups, not the shame
and the sneers, and the curses thrown back in defiance.
Why should these good folk drive us down to hell, why
should their fat faces make cowards of us? There, I
have been the coward, take the truth from me, and be
warned, heart of mine. Better death, I say, before
the ditch, for it is death in a ditch that we wretches
come to. Brave it out, sister, and for God’s love keep
your heart from bitterness, and from poisoning its own
good blood.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She still held Denise close to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did the woman St. Aguecheek say? Bah,
all lies, I tell you. Such cow-eyed women lie for the
sake of piety. The man say that of you? I know better.
Come, Denise, listen to me; I know a man when I have
looked him in the eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned Denise’s face to hers and kissed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a clean kiss,” she said, “and by its cleanness
I’ll swear that beldam Ursula lied. What of Messire
Aymery? A man, child, a rock man with an arm that
can smite. Grace be with me, but he would have given
you his own heart to mend your broken one. I spoke
with him, and I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise lay at rest in Marpasse’s lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should Ursula have lied?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do dogs eat grass, and vomit? What! I
know the woman, eyes that see the point of a pin and
miss the moon, and a tongue like a clacker in a cherry
tree. Love is lord of all, my dear, and what does that
beldam know of love? Messire Aymery had his heart
in his mouth that night. I judge that he let the old crow
peck at it, and she took the pieces and poisoned them,
and pushed them into your mouth. Go to now! Have
a little faith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked into Denise’s eyes and saw a change in
them. A more dewy and credulous April had followed
a dry and stormy March. Marpasse’s hand had stopped
the former wound. She was healing the wound now
in Denise’s soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God grant that you are right, Marpasse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better, my dear, better. Lie in my arms and think
them a man’s, and that man as honest as ever loved a
woman. May I die in a ditch if I am mistaken! And
now, what’s to do, as the sluggard says when all the
rest have been three hours a-mowing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise slipped out of Marpasse’s lap, and sat down
close to her, but not so close that their bodies touched.
This act of hers seemed to betray that she had come
by her stronger self again. Marpasse’s scolding had set
her upon her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall stay with you,” she said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse opened her mouth wide, a black circle of
mute expostulation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise looked in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not both of us?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse’s mouth still stood open as though to
scoff at her own redemption. Denise closed it with her
own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is a clean kiss,” she said, “let us keep it for
each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Marpasse caught her to her, and was a long while
silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever these two women may have said to one
another, the fact was proven that Marpasse did not rejoin
her band of vagabonds that night, for she and Denise
sat on under the tree, and counted up the money that
they could boast between them. They were like a couple
of girls talking over some new dress, their heads close
together, and their hearts lighter than they had been for
many a day. But Marpasse had her whims. She would
not mix her money with Denise’s, but kept it apart
with a sort of scorn, handling it gingerly as though the
coins were hot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover Marpasse had a practical nature, and an
attitude towards the ways and means of life that betokened
that they were the accursed riddles that gods put to
men each inevitable day. In truth Marpasse’s life
had been one long riddle, and she had grown sick of
seeking to solve it, and had put the enigma out of her
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heart of mine,” said she, “we are very much on
a dust heap, so far as I can gather. My mouth was
made to eat and drink! I cannot turn beast like the
king did and eat grass. I have a little bread here in
my bag,” and she brought out the small sack that she
carried slung to her girdle under her cloak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was drinking in new hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have the money,” she said, “we can buy food,
and I have enough for to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Innocent, there is not a loaf to be bought for miles
round. The King’s paunch would have made short
work of the very trees, only they are too tough. And
a word in your ear, treasure your money as though it
were your blood. For when a woman is starving, and
her pocket is empty, the devil comes in with a grin, and
offers to pay for a meal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can we get more money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse grimaced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must go as mendicants,” she said. “I will
thieve an old cloak, and cover up my colour.
At all events, here is our Lord the Pig. We will make
some use of him. If you are dainty, go and sit on the
far side of the tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse turned butcher that night, nor was it the
first time that she had used a knife on a carcase, for people
who live by their wits go poaching at times, even after
the King’s deer. Marpasse had no intimate knowledge
of The Charter, or the Forest Laws, save that she had
known men who had been caught, and mutilated. Being
strong and skilful she had a good skinful of meat beside
her before the dusk came down. Then she cut a hazel
stake, slung the skin with the meat on it, and going down
to a stream that crossed the road, washed the boar’s
blood from her hands and arms, and came back clean and
smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silver John will soon be up,” she said, nodding
towards the east; “if he would only drop us a few coins
the colour of his face, I should feel the happiest beggar
in the kingdom. Come along with you. We will tramp
a little farther from my gossips. If you fell in with
them you might not like their tongues.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise and Marpasse set out together, keeping a
little distance from the road, and walking under the
shadows of the trees. Soon the moon came up, and made
the May woods magical, and full of a mystery that was
clean and pure. Nightingales sang in the thickets, and
the scent of the dew on the grass and dead leaves came
with the perfume of wild flowers out of the dusk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse was in a happy mood despite a day’s tramp,
and the adventure with the boar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a feeling in me,” she said, “that Silver John
looks at us kindly out of the sky. Throw us a penny,
good Lord Moon, or some hair out of your silver beard.
Hear how the birds are singing. They shall sing a
merry jingle into our pockets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise walked beside Marpasse with a smile of peace
and of human nearness stealing upon her heart. And the
Moon who looked down on the world must have been
as wise as the breadth of his solemn face. “Strange,”
he may have thought, “here are a saint and a stroller
hand in hand, comforting one another, and making the
night mellow!” But they were both women who had
suffered as only women suffer, and the wise Moon may
have understood life, and sped them on with a glimmer
of good luck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse’s sense of a blessing that was to be, saw
its fulfilment as in the magic of an Eastern tale. They
had walked a mile or more, and were looking about
them for shelter for the night, when Marpasse stood still
to listen, with one hand at her ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ssh,” said she, “what’s in the wind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the sound of a bell that she and Denise heard,
a faint melancholy ripple like the sound of falling water
in the stillness of the night. Sometimes it ceased and
then broke out again, coming no nearer, nor dwindling
into the distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A chapel bell?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, nor a cow bell either. Poor soul, I know the
sound of it. That bell has a voice if ever a bell had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She listened awhile, and then touched Denise’s arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It comes from yonder, there, by that black clump
of yews. A leper’s bell, or I have never been a
sinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went towards the thicket of yews that stood
there as though a black cloud covered the face of the
moon. The sound of the bell grew more importunate
and human. Marpasse whispered to Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the death toll,” she said, “I have heard such
a sound before at night. The poor souls do not like to
die alone in the dark. And those who hear the bell
sometimes take pity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stretched at the foot of the yew tree with the black
plumes curving overhead, Marpasse and Denise found
an old man whose face was as white as the cloak he wore.
A hand was rocking to and fro ringing the leper bell,
whose melancholy sound seemed to die away with the
moonlight into the midnight of the yews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse bent over him, she had seen too much of
the rougher aspects of life to be greatly afraid of a leper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, father,” she said, “here is company for you,
you can stop your ringing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s arm fell like a snapped bough, and the
bell came to the earth with a dull, metallic rattle. The
skull face, unmasked now that the end was near, betrayed
that the bell carrier had been starved by the famine that
the King’s host had left behind them in those parts.
He was blind and deaf with the death fog, nor did he
know that Marpasse was near him till she spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good soul, have pity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned his blind face towards Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going yonder out of the world, and it is bad
to be alone when the evil spirits are abroad, and to hear
no prayer spoken. I rang my bell, good soul, for St.
Chrysostom, he of the golden mouth, promised me that
I should not die alone in the dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse sat down beside him, and beckoned Denise
to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rest in peace, brother. What would comfort
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man lay very still, with a face like ivory. He
scarcely seemed to breathe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Pater Noster,” he said presently, “I cannot
come by a prayer, for the words run to and fro in my
head like rabbits in a warren.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse looked at Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is a Sister who knows all the prayers,” she
said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, there is the smell of good meat a-cooking in a
prayer. I saw the Host through a leper squint not a
month ago. Pray, good souls, and I will ask the Lord
Christ to shrive me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise knelt in the grass, with Marpasse huddled
close to her, and spoke prayers for the leper’s lips, and
found comfort and sweetness for her own soul in the praying.
Presently the man held up a shaking hand, and
made the sign of the Cross in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good souls,” he asked them, speaking as though
he had a bone in his throat, “unfasten my girdle from
about my body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse’s hands answered his desire. The girdle
had a leather pouch fastened to it, and the pouch was
heavy. Marpasse gave it into his hands, and he laid
it against his mouth, and then held it towards Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would rather you had it, Sister, than some begging
friar. There is money in it, the alms of five years, and
God bless the charitable. Take it, good souls. Dead
men want no gold, though you will have candles burnt,
and prayers put up for Peter the Leper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt for his bell and they heard a great sigh come
out of his body like the sound of a spirit soaring away
on invisible wings. The bell gave a last spasmodic
tinkle that was muffled and smothered by the grass.
Then all was still, save for a light breeze that stirred
the black boughs of the yews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise knelt there awhile in prayer. Marpasse had
gone aside and had cut down a yew bough with her
knife, and was shaping the end thereof into the shape of
a narrow spade. She began to turn the sods up clear
of the roots of the trees, and Denise came and watched
her, holding the dead man’s girdle in her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took Marpasse till midnight to scratch a shallow
grave. They laid the leper in it, with his bell in his
hand, and his staff beside him, and covered him with
sods and boughs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Marpasse and Denise lay down under a tree
and slept in each other’s arms. They did not look into
the pouch that night, for the nearness of death and the
infinite pathos thereof possessed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when Denise opened the pouch next morning,
a rattle of silver came tumbling out, with here and there
a piece of gold that shone like the yellow flower of the
silverweed in the midst of its dusty foliage. Marpasse’s
blue eyes stared hard at the money. Both she and
Denise were silent for a minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor soul! We will put up prayers for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse hugged her bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God see to it,” she said. “The tide turned when
the old man’s ship put out over the dark sea.”</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXXVI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The King and his lords marched southwards through
Sussex, boasting themselves lords of the land, and very
much doubting whether Earl Simon would dare to follow
them, and meet them in the open field. At Flimwell
the King put to death certain of the country folk who
had surprised and slain some of his people in the woods.
Already many of the rough troops in Henry’s service
had begun to grumble at the emptiness of the land
through which they marched, for they had had but little
pillaging to keep them in a good humour, no great cellars
to drain dry, no towns to trifle with. The King, being
a generous man where other folks’ coffers were concerned,
as he had proved in the Sicilian farce, turned royal pimp
and purveyor to his army. The Abbey of Robertsbridge
lay in their path, and Henry let his men loose to plunder
the place, and despoiled the monks still further by making
them pay heavy ransom for their lives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news of the sacking of Robertsbridge came to
Abbot Reginald five miles away at Battle, and though
he may have rejoiced over the humbling of a rival, he
was warned by his brother Abbot’s flaying, and made
haste to appear loyal. The Cistercians of Robertsbridge
had been shrewd and greedy neighbours, and had snatched
manors and land that might have fallen to the children
of St. Benedict. Grants in Pett, Guestling, Icklesham,
Playden, and Iden, and also lands in Snargate, Worth,
Combden, Sedlescombe, and Ewhurst, showed that
there had been cause for jealousy between the two.
Reginald of Brecon may have had some thought of a
possible transference of land from the Cistercians to his
own “house.” To show his loyalty he called out his
tenants, and marched out in state as a war lord to meet
the King, carrying presents with him, and wearing a
mild and pliant manner. Riding back beside the King
he spoke sadly of the poverty of St. Martin, and how
the Pope’s perquisitions and pilferings had emptied his
treasure-chest. The King should have had it, had he
not pledged much of the Abbey plate to the Jews, but
his sweet lord was wholly welcome to such food and
drink as could be got together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abbot Reginald’s presents were perilously mean,
and were not to be bulked out by pompous language.
Even then, his discretion might not have miscarried
but for the over anxious zeal of that cunning fox, Dom
Silvius. The almoner had bleated a “gaudeamus”
over the humbling of the Cistercian upstarts at Robertsbridge.
He had sought an audience of Abbot Reginald
before the monks met in the chapter house, and had put
forward the plan that his superior actually accepted.
It might be possible to follow the middle path, pay little,
and make some profits, and at least escape from being
robbed. Silvius took upon himself the secret burying
of the Abbey treasure, and Silvius’s zeal for St. Martin
was so notorious that none of the brethren quarrelled
with his energy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Battle that night was like a garden smothered in
locusts, so thick was the swarm of armed men, servants,
vagabonds, mules and horses. Henry, Prince Edward,
the King of the Romans, and the great lords were lodged
in the Abbey, and dined in state in the abbot’s hall.
Swarthy, swaggering men were everywhere, crowding
and jostling, poking their noses into every corner of
the five boroughs, kissing the women, and taking the
food and drink that the monks and burghers surrendered
to them for the blessing of peace and piety. Troops
crowded the gardens, the orchards, and the Abbot’s
park. And though some measure of order reigned, the
atmosphere was surcharged with thunder, Reginald and
his people feeling themselves like Roman provincials
at the mercy of a host of Huns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the thick of all this sultriness Dom Silvius must
needs discover that some of the reliquaries had been
left in the Abbey church. Silvius soon had the sacristan
by the girdle, protesting fervently that the reliquaries
must be saved from possible sacrilege, and buried with
the rest of the Abbey treasure. Silvius played the part
of a mad miser and busybody that night. He had spades
brought, and sneaked out into the darkness with the
sacristan and two of the younger brothers at his heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It so happened that Dom Silvius spoilt the whole
plot by being over anxious for the property of St. Martin.
Some of Comyn’s Scotch soldiers, slinking about for
anything to thieve, caught the monks burying the reliquaries
in a piece of garden ground beyond the great
<span class='it'>garde-robe</span>. The Scotchmen were quick to scent a
trick, collared Silvius and his comrades, brought torches
and tools, and set to work on their own authority. Not
only did they discover two of the reliquaries that had
been buried, but struck their spades on the whole of
the Abbey treasure that had been hidden in a pit. Scotchmen,
monks, treasure, torches, and all went in a whirl
to the great hall where the King was dining. And Abbot
Reginald hid his face in a flagon when he saw Silvius
dragged in, spitting like a furious cat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King’s eyes were not pleasant to behold. He
had the “merry-thought” of a chicken in his hand,
and was scraping the flesh from it with a silver knife.
He looked attentively at the treasure that Comyn’s
men tumbled on the floor below the dais. Then he broke
the “merry-thought” in two, and folding the pieces in
his fist, bade Reginald choose his lot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reginald of Brecon pulled out the shorter of the two.
The King laughed, a dry cackle that was ominous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The shorter the bone, the shorter the shrift, gentlemen,”
he said. “We will take care of this treasure for
you, my lord Abbot. As for the cellars, storehouses,
burgher tenements, and all such belongings, we make
a night’s gift of them to those who thirst and
hunger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was loud laughter, and a babel of voices. The
flushed gentry at the table shouted “God strengthen the
King.” One monk alone was mad enough to throw
himself between St. Martin and the pleasantry of the
royal spite, and that monk was Dom Silvius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke loose, and rushed with furious and stuttering
face to the high table, brandishing his cross, fanatical as
any Egyptian hermit out of the desert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spoiler of the houses of God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bacon was following the fat into the fire. Abbot
Reginald, good man, lost patience, and threw his platter
in Silvius’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius, with a gobbet of gravy on his nose, looked
comic enough, but still burnt like a Telemachus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God shall revenge sacrilege! Let the curse of
St. Martin——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Someone from behind took him by the collar, and
twisted a fist into the folds till Silvius was in danger of
being choked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The King lay back in his chair and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take the prophet away, and let him be washed,”
he said. “By the heart of King Richard, I have no
use to-night for an Elijah!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this way it came about that Dom Silvius took a
ride on the back of an ass, with his feet lashed under
the beast’s belly, and a dirty pot forced down over
his ears. The mob pelted Silvius with stones and offal
till he was a mere image covered with blood and
dirt. Comyn’s Scots had the privilege of bringing the
martyrdom to an end. They took Silvius from the
back of the ass, and carrying him into the place where
the treasure had been buried, pitched him into the
<span class='it'>garde-robe</span> drain, and so left him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silvius’s blundering had, however, a grimmer significance,
for it brought upon the Abbey and the town that
straggled about it the same fate that had befallen the
despised Cistercians. The King had given the place
over to plunder, and it was at the mercy of the rough
soldiery who were doubly insolent with the fumes of
mead and wine. The folk of the borough of Battle
might well have cursed Silvius and the Abbey treasure,
for the devil was let loose among them that May
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor did the darkness hide the violence and the horror,
for the very furniture was thrown out into the street
and piled up amid the faggots to help the bonfires that
lit the sport of war. Women and children fled like
frightened birds into the darkness, and were thrice blessed
if they were not caught, and held. The gaudy queans
who had followed the army played King of the Castle
on the high altar of the church, pulling each other down
by the skirts, shouting, and tumbling over one another
on the steps. Drunken men burst in the door of the
bell tower, and set all the bells clanging in huge discords.
Others caught the monks, and made them race naked
round the cloisters, whipping them with their girdles to
make them nimble.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard and some of his fellows had come by a cask
of wine, and Gaillard had Black Isoult, Marpasse’s comrade,
under his arm, and was well content with the lady.
They needed a house for a night’s revel, and chose one
in the main street, a stone house that joined a forge.
Gaillard’s men broke down the door, while their captain
held a torch, and Isoult sat on the wine cask, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the door gave way they were met in the dark
entry by a virago with a hatchet, none other than Bridget,
the smith’s wife, who had stormed against Denise. The
men fell back from her, but Isoult showed herself more
valiant, and quite a match for the lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make way, Gammer Goodbody,” she said, “make
way for the red gown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bridget answered her with an oath, and a word that
was too familiar to Isoult’s ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little woman’s black eyes sparkled with spite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is a respectable slut,” she said, “who has not
learnt to kiss the foot of a lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she cut Bridget across the forearm with her
knife, so that the smith’s wife dropped her hatchet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard sent his men in, and they overpowered the
woman. But Isoult would not let them harm her. Her
own spirit of wickedness was equal to taming the big
shrew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made them cut off Bridget’s hair, dress her in
some of her man’s clothes, tie a lamb’s skin under her
chin, and truss her with her hands fastened to her ankles.
Then while she drank wine with Gaillard and made merry,
seated on a bench, her red gown the colour of freshly
shed blood, she had Bridget rolled across the floor and
propped up near her like a sick duck. Isoult made a
mock of the smith’s wife that night because of the thing
she had called her, asking her where her marriage lines
were, and why her man had not come home. Sometimes
she threw the dregs from her ale horn into Bridget’s face,
and called her a she-goat and a rabbit. Bridget still
had the courage to curse back again, though her tongue
was less clever than Isoult’s. But when Isoult took a
burning stick from the fire, and began to singe Dame
Bridget’s stockings, the woman took to screaming, and
pleaded for pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Dom Silvius let the devil loose in Battle, and the
memory of that night lingered for many a long day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Isoult’s comrade Marpasse, she and Denise had
come to Grinstead amid the woods, and were lodged in
the house of a woman who fed swine and kept a wayside
inn. At Grinstead they heard the news that Earl Simon
and the Barons’ host had left London with fifteen thousand
burghers to swell their ranks, and were on the march to
deal with the King. The army would pass not far from
Grinstead, so said the woman of the inn, and Marpasse
and Denise took counsel together and put their plans in
order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love carries the sword,” said Marpasse, and laughed
and kissed Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can never look him in the face again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah, grey goose! There will be wounds to be
healed. A woman’s hands are useful when the trumpets
are hoarse and tired.”</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXXVII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>On the evening of Tuesday, the 13th of May, the Barons
lay amid the woods about Fletching, knowing that they
were to march on the morrow to offer the King battle
outside Lewes town. All hope of peace had gone, and
both parties had thrown away the scabbard. Henry
believed that he had Earl Simon at his mercy, for the
royal host far outnumbered the Earl’s, and where De
Montfort could count in part only on burgher levies,
the King and his favourites had the flower of the foreign
mercenaries in their pay. Henry had refused to listen
to the Bishops of London and Worcester, who had come
from the Earl. God was delivering Simon and his turbulent
following into the royal hands, and the King was not
to be cheated of his opportunity by the tongues of meddlesome
priests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the evening sun sank towards the west, the Barons’
host gathered and stood to their arms with the fresh
green of the May woods spreading a virgin canopy above
their spears. It was no gorgeous pageant so far as pomp
and circumstance were concerned. There were many
banners and pennons brilliant in the evening sunshine,
but the bulk of De Montfort’s army was made up of the
lesser gentry, and their retainers, and the burghers of
the towns, plain men, but men who were in grim and
sober earnest. Many of them had never fought in their
lives before, and Gaillard, and such gallants in the King’s
service, laughed when they spoke of the herd of hogs they
were to chase through the Sussex woodlands. But the
stocky, brown-faced men of the English towns, and the
English manors were not to be trampled on so easily.
Men who could fell timber, and handle the scythe, the
bill and the hammer, were tough in the arms, and sound
and strong at heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Barons’ host went on its knees that evening, its
lines of steel seaming the green woods. Lords, knights,
gentlemen, yeomen, burghers, knelt with their shields
before them, their swords naked in the grass, their heads
uncovered. Between the ranks of these silent, steel-clad
figures came the Bishop of Worcester, and many
priests with him, chanting as they came. The whole
host was confessed, absolved, and blessed under the oak
trees of the Fletching woods. It was as though the heart
of England was shrived that day, before the national
ordeal of battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Holy Cross, Holy Cross.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Men came running and shouting through the ranks,
carrying bales of white cloth which they spread on the
grass, and tore into hundreds of strips. Every fighting
man was to carry the White Cross on his breast. And
in the midst of it all Earl Simon and a great company of
lords and gentlemen came riding through, wearing the
White Cross on their surcoats. Swords and spears were
tossed aloft, and the heart of the host went up in sound
like the long roar of a stormy sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under a great oak tree De Montfort knighted many
of the younger lords and gentlemen, among them Robert
de Vere, John de Burgh the son of the great justiciary,
and young Gilbert, Earl of Gloucester. Then he and his
sons and his captains went everywhere, heartening their
men, bidding them rest and eat, and keep strong and
lusty against the morrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As De Montfort was riding back with young Gloucester,
and a few knights and gentlemen of his own household
to the manor house where he had his quarters, he came
upon several women standing under the shade of an old
yew. It happened that Earl Simon had put abroad
an order that no women should be suffered to follow
the army on the march. If the King and his host had
seven hundred courtesans in their camp, that was the
King’s affair; De Montfort would have none of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Earl Simon ordered his gentlemen to halt, and turned
aside alone towards the yew tree. Two of the women
had come forward, and were waiting as though to speak
with the Earl. De Montfort had a frown on his face.
Great soldier that he was, he had his rough and passionate
moods; his strong sincerity sometimes ran away with
his tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two women went on their knees before Earl
Simon’s horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sire,” said the elder of the two, “put your anger
away. We are here for love of the White Cross.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Straight speaking, and a straight look of the eyes
were things that De Montfort loved. The armed men
who watched and waited, wondered why Earl Simon
tarried there talking, and did not send the women
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Montfort’s face had begun to shine like the face
of a saint. He looked very thoughtfully at the two
women as they laid their lives in the hollow of his hand.
The plan was Marpasse’s, but Denise would not suffer
her comrade to carry it out alone. Their plan was to
go as spies to Lewes that night, and bring back any news
that they could gather as to what the King purposed to
do on the morrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Earl Simon would have none of it at first. Perhaps
he doubted their honesty; yet the two women contrived
to convince him, Marpasse sly and valiant, Denise with
the quiet eyes of one who has chosen a certain part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Montfort appeared puzzled by Denise. Marpasse
saw the look, and broke in in her blunt, bold way:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is not of my clay, sire, but we were baked in
the same oven. She has seized this trick of mine, and
will not let it out of her hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that so, child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s eyes met his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not afraid, sire,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Earl still shirked accepting a possible sacrifice.
Marpasse put in a final word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Though it be to my shame, lord,” she said, “I have
learnt how to tread among thorns. There is only one
thing that I would ask, and that is the right to choose the
man who shall take us within two miles of Lewes town.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flashed a look at Denise as though to silence her,
and went close to De Montfort’s horse. A smile came
over his face as he listened to Marpasse, and there was
sadness in the smile, and the quiet compassion of a man
who had held children in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God guard you both,” he said, “it shall be as you
desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery had command of the guard that evening at
the manor house where Simon, the Earl of Gloucester,
and the great lords had their quarters. Word was brought
him by an esquire of De Montfort’s son Guy, that the
Earl was calling for him, and that Simon was to be found
in the great barn where the Bishop of Worcester was to
preach to the lords and gentlemen before sundown.
Aymery found the Earl sitting on a barrow that stood
on the threshing floor, a knot of knights standing behind
him, and the evening sunlight that poured in striking
silver burs from their battle harness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simon looked straight into Aymery’s eyes as he gave
him his orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go down to the yew tree near the pond where we
water our horses, messire. You will find two women
waiting there. They have sworn to spy out the land for
us. Take a guide and ten spears, and see the women
as near to Lewes as you can without breaking cover.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Earl Simon always eyed his men as though he were
looking into the brain behind the eyes. Aymery saluted,
and turned to obey. His face betrayed no surprise,
though it was a new thing for De Montfort to rely on
the wits of two women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simon called him back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait, and keep watch in the woods,” he said,
“the women will try to bring back news. We shall
be on the move before dawn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose from the barrow, and crossing the threshing
floor, laid a hand on Aymery’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is in my heart to catch the King napping to-morrow,”
he said. “I trust England with you, in this,
and some of us may have to suffer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stood considering something a moment, frowning
a little, his hand still on Aymery’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The two women yonder, brave hearts, have talked
me into suffering this. I would not put such work upon
a woman, but then, my son, we all carry the Cross.
Hasten, and God speed you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Aymery went out from before him, thinking of
the two women as women, and nothing more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse, who had spun her net very cleverly, and
whose hope had been to catch and entangle a man and
a woman therein, was bitterly disgusted at the way things
happened. She had made up her mind that she herself
would go to Lewes, but she had no intention of taking
Denise into the hell of the royal camp. She certainly
caught these two people in her net, but they broke the
threads, and would not do as she desired. Yet Marpasse
might have seen how it would be had she not been too
eager to sweep away Denise’s pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise was standing by her, with the sunlight on her
hair and face, waiting in all innocence for the escort that
Earl Simon was to send for them. A prophetic fore-gleam
of self-sacrifice played in the deeps of her brown eyes.
She had seized on Marpasse’s plan and clasped it as something
precious and something actively alive. The solemn
shriving of that great host under the oaks of the Fletching
woods had sent the blood to Denise’s brain. She felt
herself in the midst of strong men who held their swords
aloft and prayed. She was as one who saw a sacred fire
burning, and was driven to throw herself therein with the
ardour of a soul that seeks martyrdom in some great
cause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse, who had a corner of each eye very wide
awake for the coming of the man on the black horse,
began to wonder how Denise would meet the truth.
And Marpasse’s expectations came back limply to roost
like birds that had been drenched in a thunder shower.
She had struck a spark into Denise’s soul, and the spark
blazed up into a beacon that Marpasse could not
smother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery came riding down past the great pool where
troopers were watering their horses, the beasts trampling
and splashing in the oozy shallows, and sucking lustily
despite the mud. Marpasse soon marked him down,
and watched his face as they came within his ken. Marpasse
saw Aymery go red as a boy, and being comforted
by the man’s colour, she stole a glance at Denise. Denise’s
face had been shining like the face of one inspired.
Marpasse saw it cloud suddenly as though a shadow
had fallen across it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they met, with the women under the yew tree fifty
paces away watching them, and the splashing of the
horses and the voices of the men merging into the great
murmur that seemed to fill the woods. For the moment
Aymery had nothing to say. Marpasse could have pricked
him with the point of her knife to make him leap out of
that slough of silence. Denise stood in the long grass,
a whorl of golden flowers brushing her grey gown, her
face white and troubled in the sunlight. Marpasse might
have had a pair of dumb and irresponsive puppets on
her hands. There was nothing left for her but to pull
the strings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am the brown woman who mended a wound,
lording,” she began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery remembered her well enough. His face
resembled a grey sky through which the sun was trying
to shine and could not. He had his heart in his mouth
but Denise did not help him. She stood there, as though
her thoughts soared into some cold and brilliant corner
of heaven. Yet only the surface had the sheen of ice.
The deeps beneath were full of flux and tumult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse, being a plain and impetuous woman, could
have nudged both of them, and prompted both, at one
and the same moment. Matters were not moving as
she had forecasted, and these two people looked afraid
of one another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A kiss on the mouth, lording, and your arms round
her,” that was what she would have said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her words were:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Earl Simon may have told you the news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the sharp look that Aymery gave Denise, Marpasse
guessed that he knew the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Lewes?” he asked her, with the uneasy air
of a man urging himself to do something that seemed
strangely difficult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we women, lording, can be of use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He repeated the words, looking at Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Lewes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse grimaced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God knows, we shall be walking on hot bricks,”
she said; “but then, this blue gown, and this face of
mine, are better than passwords.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s eyes were still upon Denise, as though
waiting for one word or look from her. He could not
see that she was as passionately mute as he was, and
that a spasm of self-consciousness held her in thrall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse broke in, feeling the silence like thorns in
her flesh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can do without her, lording. Listen to me,
Golden-head. They shall put me within a mile of Lewes
town, and wait in the woods for any news that I can
gather. You need not play the moth to the candle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse saw Aymery’s eyes flash something at her
that made her less uneasy. The judgment lay with
Denise. They looked at her and waited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise looked at neither. She hid everything, nor
was there a ripple of emotion about her mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall go with you, Marpasse,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big woman shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah, I can as well take one of the others with me.
They would play the part better, and look less dangerous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise kept her eyes from Aymery, as though her
pride had set itself a pilgrimage, and would not see
anything that might hinder it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say what you please, I shall go with you, as I
promised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse nodded her head, and seemed to consider
the situation. Biting her lips, she looked from Aymery
to Denise. Neither of them helped her, and Marpasse
could have stamped her foot at the man, and told him
what to do. “Fool, take her away from me, and hold
her fast!” She shrugged her broad shoulders, and
laughed a little mockingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are all talking so much,” she said, “that we
shall get nowhere to-night unless we tie up our tongues.
You, lording, can find us a couple of mules or asses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse’s sarcasm sank into sand, for Denise turned
and walked back towards the rest of the women who
were making a meal under the yew tree. Some of them
were using their needles, and sewing the white crosses
on to the surcoats of the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will say good-bye to them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps there was a set purpose in this act of hers,
for Denise would have Aymery see the comrades with
whom she had travelled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery was turning his horse when Marpasse caught
his bridle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lording,” she said, “keep the fog out of your eyes.
We, and the rest yonder, followed the host to do what
we could when men were knocked out of the saddle.
I have changed my cloth, if not the colour of it. She
has done that for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up almost fiercely into Aymery’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak to her on the way, lording. Women are not
won by looking, charge home, and let the trumpets
blow, unless,” and she let go the bridle, “unless my lord
has changed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man’s eyes answered her that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marpasse, have you forgotten that night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not I, nor you, lording.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seemed death then, but now——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse’s eyes flashed up at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Man, man, what makes the hills blaze, a wet fog,
or the sunset?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dusk was beginning to fall when they set off into the
woods, Denise upon a grey palfrey that a priest had
lent them, Marpasse perched on a mule, Aymery and
his men in full battle harness, their spears trailing under
the trees. They had a guide with them, a swineherd
who knew every path and ride even by night, and though
the sun was touching the horizon, they had before them
the long twilight of a clear evening in May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery sent the guide on ahead with the men-at-arms,
and Marpasse, knowing what she knew, manœuvred
her mule so as to leave Aymery with Denise. But the
priest’s palfrey seemed to have conceived a great affection
for Marpasse’s mule. Denise had hardly a word to say.
She kept close beside Marpasse and appeared blind to the
glimmerings of that good woman’s impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse could bear it out no longer. She struck
her mule several resounding smacks with her open hand,
and the beast went away at a lazy canter, leaving Denise
and the man on the black horse together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May God untie their tongues,” Marpasse said to
herself; “it is a curse to have too quick a conscience.
I shall be hoisted on my own fire unless the man can
bring her to reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Marpasse rode on behind the men-at-arms, leaving
the two to work out their own salvation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woods were steeped in a green twilight, and a great
stillness reigned everywhere, save for the song of the birds.
Here and there a great tree stood tongued as with fire.
The foliage grew black against the golden glow in the
west, while long slants of light still stole in secretly along
the solemn aisles. The birds were at their vespers, and
a cold dew was falling, drawing out the fresh perfume
of the woods at night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery and Denise were riding side by side, the
woman pale, sad-eyed, yet resolute, the man sunk in that
deep silence that follows some ineffectual and passionate
outburst of the heart. They seemed afraid of one
another, nor could they meet each other’s eyes. Denise’s
white face might have stood for the moon. And though
the birds sang, their voices gave the dusk a sadder and a
stranger mystery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery spoke at last, passing a hand over his horse’s
mane.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our Lady keep you,” he said, “I will not quarrel
with your desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s lips were dry, and she felt as though the old
wound had broken over her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I have suffered,” she said simply, “I have learnt
what life is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Self-martyrdom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice woke echoes that she strove to smother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is God’s whim in me, perhaps, that I should prove
myself. Marpasse and I will go together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Night had come and the glare of many fires lit the
southern sky when they reached the edge of the woodland
and saw the great downs black, and vague and ominous.
The men were waiting under the woodshaw, and Marpasse
stood rubbing the nose of her mule. She could
hear voices, slow, suppressed, stricken into short, pregnant
sentences like the disjointed fragments of a song struck
from untuned lutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had left her palfrey under a tree. She came
out from the shadows, and taking Marpasse in her arms,
kissed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We go together, you and I,” she said. “No, no, say
nothing to me, it is my heart’s desire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse held her, and was mute. She looked towards
a shadowy figure on a shadowy horse, and Denise understood
the look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have told him, he will not hinder me in this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heart of mine, stay here in the woods. I can go
alone, my carcase is of no account.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise would not be put away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marpasse,” she said, “this is our Lord’s true passion
working in me. Nor shall the cup from which He drank
be snatched from me to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse was silent, feeling a greatness near her that
awed her rebellious impulses. She kissed Denise, and
was very humble, thinking that she herself had brought
this thing to pass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come then,” she said, “it may be that God goes
with us to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery, standing with one arm over his horse’s
neck, watched them disappear into the darkness, the
swineherd going with them to show them the road to
the town. The whole northern sky still burnt with a
faint glow of gold, and in the south a hundred fires
flickered amid the black folds of the downs. And Aymery
watched these distant fires, thinking with grim impatience
of the King’s host that lay yonder like a great dragon
ready to tear and slay.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The King and Richard the Roman were lodged that
night at the Priory of St. Pancras, Prince Edward with
De Warenne in the castle of Lewes. Nor would it have
been easy to choose between St. Pancras Priory and
Lewes Town in the matter of furious and indiscriminate
drinking. Some said that the King’s host mustered
sixty thousand men. One thing was certain, that a very
great number of them were drunk that night, and that
the lords and captains were no better than the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The King will hunt swine to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the night’s apothegm, and men flung it
with variations and with a liberal garnishing of oaths
into each other’s faces. The metaphor was acceptable
to those who were in their cups, and much repetition
piled assurance upon assurance. The great army of
the King had its head full of drunken insolence. Its
mouth uttered one huge oath. It would only have to
show itself on the morrow, and De Montfort’s dirty
burghers would take to their heels and run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bonfires had been lit everywhere, and round them
were crowds of grotesque faces that bawled, and gulped,
and fed. There was no lack of food and drink, sheep and
oxen were roasted whole; men gorged themselves like
dogs about the carcases. Cressets flared upon the castle
towers, and Prince Edward had set twenty trumpeters
to blow fanfares before the gate. The Priory bells were
jangling like fuddled men quarrelling with one another.
There was no discipline anywhere, no sign of a high
purpose, no forethought for the morrow. “The King
will hunt swine!” Men bellowed it to one another, and
the superstition contented them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Denise and Marpasse came near the west gate
of the town, they saw a huge fire burning there, the flames
lighting the black battlements above. A great crowd
had gathered about the fire, and the noise might have
equalled the noise at Barnet Fair. Men were running
about half naked like hairy-legged satyrs mad with wine.
The platform of the town gate was crowded with a
roaring, squealing mob that amused itself by emptying
nature upon the equally repulsive mob below. Mounted
upon a tub, a man with one eye, dressed like a Franciscan,
spouted indecent skits on the clergy, pretending the while
to be zealously in earnest. Elsewhere a crowd of excited
and contorted figures made a ring round two women who,
stripped to the waist, were wrestling, their faces smeared
with the blood of a dead ox. Drunken rascals were
scrambling about on all fours, and pretending to be dogs.
If any mad whim came into a man’s head, he acted on
it, and did not stop to think.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse had taken Denise by the wrist, and they had
melted back into the darkness, holding their breath over
the chance of being plunged into that simmering human
stew. Marpasse was no innocent, but her face went hard
and ugly with the sincerity of her disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drunken swine! We will keep away from your sty,
I warrant you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke in a harsh whisper, her pupils contracting
as she stared at the gate and the bonfire that was half
hidden by live things that swarmed like beetles. Denise
shuddered inwardly, and was silent. She thought of the
cool, dark woods over yonder, and of the grim and quiet
men who waited for the dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse waved an arm towards the town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” she seemed to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are like wild beasts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you think to find, my dear; blessed banners
and crosses, and priests galore? Or perhaps so many Sir
Tristans keeping watch under the stars, and thinking of
noble and great ladies. No, no, the King and Earl Simon
handle their hot coals differently. Come away, we shall
do no good yonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They retreated along the road, and hearing loud
squeals of laughter near them, drew aside, and hid themselves
in a ditch. Marpasse could feel Denise shivering.
When the laughter had gone by them towards the town,
Marpasse stood up and looked about her in the
darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were walking into the cattle market,” she said
in an ironical whisper. “The Priory lies yonder, most
likely the King is lodged there. Pick your feet up out
of this mud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They scrambled out of the ditch, and leaving the road,
went on cautiously hand in hand. Marpasse’s eyes seemed
like the eyes of a cat. Sometimes they stopped to listen,
standing close together as though for comfort. The darkness,
rendered more weird and baffling by the glare of the
watch fires, seemed to threaten them with all manner of
evil shapes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An overbearing desire to talk mastered Denise. The
sound of her own voice tended to smother the whisperings
of panic. Marpasse let her run on till the mass of the
Priory began to blacken the clear sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ssh,” she said, “we shall need our ears now, more
than our tongues. If we are stopped by any of these
gentry, leave the talking to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s face flashed up into Denise’s consciousness.
Her hand contracted convulsively upon Marpasse’s
wrist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Earl Simon could have fallen on them to-night,”
she whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow will do, or I am no prophet,” answered
Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Priory of St. Pancras was shut in by its great
precinct wall, but Marpasse and Denise found it only
too easy to make their way within. There was a guard
at the Priory gate, but the men were drinking and dicing,
letting the night look after itself. People did what they
pleased, and St. Pancras had no heavenly say in the
matter. The men of the sword had pushed the good
saint into a corner, his monks, too, were exceeding meek
and docile, holding to the Christian doctrine that one
must suffer in the spirit of patience. Yet their patience
was largely a matter of discretion and of necessity, for
put power in a priest’s hands and he is a tyrant among
tyrants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Booths had been set up inside the precinct wall, and
there were clowns who kept the crowd a-laughing, and
minstrels who sang songs fit for the lowest ear. Women
in bright-coloured clothes went to and fro between the
bonfires, fierce, hawk-faced women who knew how to take
care of their own concerns. Marpasse and Denise kept
in the shadow, though there were things to stumble over
in the darkness, as Marpasse found when she trod on
something that kicked out at her and cursed. They
wandered into the cloisters, and through the dark passage-ways
and slypes; all doors were open, and no one hindered
them, for no one seemed to boast any authority that
night. Sometimes they stood in dark corners, and listened
to what was said by those who passed. St. Pancras
might have stood with his fingers in his ears, for the humour
was very broad, and the language primitive. “The King
will hunt swine to-morrow.” The same snatch served here
as in Lewes town, and Marpasse understood the significance
thereof. The King meant to attack De Montfort
on the morrow, and was letting his men debauch themselves
into reckless good humour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great church was full of tawny light, all the doors
stood open, and Marpasse and Denise gliding from buttress
to buttress, looked in through the door of the north transept.
Torches had been stuck about the walls, the smoke
pouring up, and filling the dim distance of the vaulting
with drifting vapour. The church was full of men and
women in cloths and silks of the brightest colours, men
and women who danced and drank, and sprawled about
the flagged floors. Nor were the men from the common
crowd of the King’s army; they were the lords, the
knights, and the esquires, wild captains of free-lances
who held a debauch before to-morrow’s battle. The high
altar was like a rostrum in old Rome, seized upon by a
drunken crowd, and covered with creatures that laughed
and howled, and clung to one another. Some of the
women had put on the men’s helmets, others wore garlands
of half-withered flowers. A party of young nobles
had broken open the sacristy, and dressed themselves
in precious embroidered vestments. The scene was a
scramble of colour, a scene of perpetual movement,
of flux and reflux, of strong sensual life throbbing in and
out of half-darkened sanctuaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse had seen enough, and Denise too much.
They were moving away, when Marpasse started aside
and drew Denise into the shadow of a buttress. A blur
of movement disentangled itself from the darkness, and
took shape in a knot of figures that approached the
transept door. The party halted, and the two women
saw a man wearing a cloak of sables, and a surcoat of
some golden stuff, come forward alone and stand looking
into the church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The glare from the torches fell upon the face of the
man who wore the sable cloak. It was a handsome face,
yet weak and troubled, the face of a man without great
self-restraint, a man who would attempt to be violent
when he should be patient, and who would betray his
weakness when he needed strength. There was something
tragic about the figure standing there alone, and
looking in upon the wild night before the dawn of the
morrow. It might have been the figure of a magician
gazing upon the fierce and elemental things that he had
brought into being, and who had lost the power of holding
them under his spell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse saw the man cross himself, and turn away
with an air that suggested foreshadowings of disaster. It
was a figure full of infinite significance, in that it had striven
continually to strut upon the world’s stage, and yet
had never succeeded in being more than a puppet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse had whispered in Denise’s ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The King!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The poor fool! He is not a shepherd like Earl
Simon. Even his sheep dogs are out of hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he had come out of the darkness, so he disappeared,
silently, almost furtively, with no blare of trumpets and
no tossing of torches. Men who were wise saw in him
a thing that was sometimes a saint, sometimes a mean,
contriving Jew, often a firebrand, more often still a
beauty-loving fool. Brave enough in battle, and a
clean liver, yet the grim, animal energy of his father might
have served him better than his own flickering and inconstant
brilliancy. Henry could delight in the colour
of a painted window, and he had the heart of a sentimental
woman. In one thing alone he may have been of use,
for his follies taught the stronger son to be warned by
the mistakes of a weak father. Henry made war
against the spirit of liberty stirring in the heart of a
great people. Edward the Strong was wiser in knowing
the nature of his own strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse nudged Denise, and pulled her hood forward
over her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have seen enough,” she said; “they are to hunt
swine to-morrow! Good, very good, let them beware
of the boar’s tusks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They made their way back towards the gate, and St.
Pancras, kind saint, blessed them, for they escaped unscathed
out of the place. And coming out to the cool
darkness that covered the downs, they sat down side
by side to wait for the dawn.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XXXIX</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse was up as soon as the first grey light began
to spread above the hills, and it was possible for them
to see their way. Denise had passed the night, lying
with her head in Marpasse’s lap, and sleeping soundly
despite her promise to remain awake. Marpasse
had smiled, and let her sleep, trusting to her own
ears and eyes to warn her of the approach of any
peril.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were on the move while the land was still half
in shadow, for Marpasse was as eager as any man to
let Earl Simon know the truth about the King. Standing
and looking back on Lewes as the dawn increased,
Marpasse could gauge how cheaply the King and his
captains held their enemy. There were Gascons too
with Henry, and the Gascons should have known what
manner of man they had to deal with in Earl Simon.
Yet the green slopes of the downs, gleaming with dew
as the golden light of the dawn began to play on them,
were utterly deserted. The King’s host lay snoring
after its debauch, without a single troop of horse to
patrol the hills. Only on the hill that was afterwards
called Mount Harry could Marpasse distinguish what
appeared to be a solitary sentinel. And he, too, was
lying like a grey stone on the hillside, asleep at his post
while the sun made the east splendid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse clapped her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fools!” she said; “come, there is no time to
lose. We ought to bear more yonder towards the west.
They will be on the watch for us. I know of one man
who will have been awake all night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at Denise and saw her redden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give him one kiss, heart of mine,” she said, “for
a man fights the better with his woman’s kiss upon his
mouth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, it will be the last, Marpasse,” she retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah, have you had him killed already!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be the last whatever happens,” said Denise
sadly. “Do you think that I would let him make so poor
a bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse would have taken her to task for showing
such hypersensitive self-consciousness, had not a horseman
appeared above the crest of a low hill, and come
galloping down into the freshness of the May morning.
Marpasse looked at him as he came up, and the man’s
face shone in the sunlight. He was out of the saddle,
and standing by Denise, as though it was not easy for
him to keep his hands from touching her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse laughed, and looked brown and joyous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see, lording,” she said, “I have brought her
back fresh as a white may bough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>None the less the may bough had a rich colour.
Marpasse turned her back on them, and looked intently
towards Lewes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lording,” she said, “I give you while I count fifty.
There is no time to lose, for the King means to fight
to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether she wished it or not, Denise found her
hands in Aymery’s. He stood and looked into her eyes,
and neither of them said a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten,” quoth Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s face came nearer to Denise’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My desire,” he said, “if I live through it, I would
have your heart for mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had gone red at first, but she was as white
now as her shift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord,” she said, “I cannot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah! Twenty!” called Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s eyes were like the pleading eyes of a dog.
He remembered what Marpasse had said to him. Yet
despite her vigorous counsel the great love in him made
him reverent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why <span class='it'>cannot</span>?” he asked her simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up at him and her eyes swam with tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because of—of the pride in me, because of all that
has happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool, kiss her! Thirty!” murmured Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery still held Denise’s hands. Yet he was looking
beyond her towards the town hazy with the golden mist
of the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was I who brought it on you,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt Denise shudder, and the impulse mastered
him, he drew her to him, and kissed her upon the
mouth. She did not resist, but her mouth was cold,
and her eyes troubled. Gaillard’s shadow seemed to
come between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forty,” called Marpasse, “and a buxom age for a
woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery let go of Denise’s hands. He stood with
bowed head, looking into her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever God wills to-day,” he said, “remember
the words that I have spoken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifty,” trilled Marpasse. “I will see to it, lording.
Up on your horse, my gallant. They are all in a drunken
sleep yonder at Lewes, and there is not a man of them
on the watch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned, and glanced sharply from Aymery to
Denise. And the wet, passionate trouble in Denise’s
eyes betrayed to Marpasse how things were tending.
It was best to leave the tenderness to ripen of itself
that day, for none but a woman understands a woman’s
heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery was in the saddle. His man’s face had grown
tense and keen, the face of the strenuous fighter who
puts softer things aside. And Marpasse loved him for
that hawk’s look of his, and the way he spread his pinions
to the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Simon is marching through the Newick woods,”
he said; “if he can but come in time, he can seize and
take the ground that pleases him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked down at Denise, and Marpasse understood
the look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ride, lording,” she said, “leave us to follow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery drew his sword, and kissed the blade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise!” and wheeling his horse he went away at
a gallop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Montfort had the news soon after dawn that May
morning as his host came streaming through the woods
of Newick. Sending forward a company of knights and
men-at-arms under young De Clare and William de Monchesny,
Simon followed on with the main body, climbing
the narrow coombe that led to the chalk ridge running
westwards from Lewes town. The vanguard had found
Marpasse’s solitary sentinel still asleep on the hillside,
and they woke him roughly, and laughed at his gaping
and astonished face. Meanwhile the main host gained
the ridge, and pouring on steadily in the morning sunshine,
did not halt their banners till they could see the bell tower
of the Priory of St. Pancras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simon, who had been carried in a litter through the
Newick woods because of a wrenched tendon in the leg,
mounted his horse, and rode out in front of the ranks.
Standing in the stirrups he spoke a few brave words to
hearten his men, pointed to the white cross he wore,
and commended himself and the host to God.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God, and the Cross,” the shout came back to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some knelt, others prostrated themselves, with arms
outspread, and kissed the earth. The King would have
to fight an army of zealots that morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>De Montfort soon had his battle in order. He divided
his host into three main bodies, each holding one of the
promontories or spurs into which the chalk ridge broke
on the side towards Lewes. On the northern spur that
stretched towards the castle stood the Londoners under
Nicholas de Segrave. Young Gilbert de Clare had the
centre, and with him were John Fitz-John and William
de Monchesny and the pick of the Barons’ host. On
the southern spur were De Montfort’s two sons, Guy
and Henry, and with them Humphrey de Bohun and
John de Burgh. Simon himself remained with the
reserve, and he had called about him some of the men
whom he could trust to the last blow, men whom he
could weld together, and hurl like rock into the fight,
to beat back a charge or to tear a passage. Aymery and
Waleran de Monceaux were with Earl Simon, knee to
knee, and speaking hardly at all. To deceive the King,
De Montfort’s litter was packed with certain London
merchants who had plotted against the cause, and set
with the Earl’s standard on the higher ground towards
the west. There also was stationed the baggage. Young
William le Blund had command of the guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Barons’ men, resting in their places after a nine
miles’ march, and quietly making a meal, were able to
watch at their leisure and to their own comfort the scurry
and alarm in the town and Priory below. The King’s
host ran to arms amid infinite confusion. Trumpets
blew, bells rang, banners went tossing hither and thither
like bright clothes blown abroad by the wind. Something
suspiciously like a panic had seized some of the less
disciplined troops camped about the Priory. Knights
and captains who had scrambled into their battle harness,
had to ride in among their men and beat courage into
them with the flat of the sword. Prince Edward, who
had the flower of knighthood with him in the castle,
was the first to take the field. They came pouring out
from the town and the castle, a gorgeous cataract of
heavily-armed men, surcoats ablaze, shields flashing
gules and or, azure, argent, and vert; pennons jigging,
banners aslant from gilded banner staffs. Their van
curled like a brilliant billow carrying the masts of many
ships, and flecked with steel for foam. The great,
grotesque war helmets were like the masks of strange
creatures called up by a magician’s wand. Their
trumpets rang out cheerily, sending a thrill through the
hearts of Simon’s men. The Londoners, who faced this
mass of lords and knights, and burly free-lances, began
to talk too much, and to give each other orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise and Marpasse were with the baggage behind
De Montfort’s standard. They had climbed into a
waggon, and could see a great part of the field stretched
out before them. Dark columns were pouring up from
the Priory, and Marpasse, who was watching them, caught
Denise by the arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look yonder, they have hoisted the Red Dragon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole of Simon’s host had seen it also, for a long
sullen roar rose like that of a wave breaking upon
shingle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does the red banner mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mean!” and Marpasse bit her lips in her excitement;
“death to all, no prisoners, and no quarter if
the King wins. That is the song of the Red Dragon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise said nothing. Marpasse glanced at her with
a sudden, sidelong stare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not grudge him that one kiss,” she said,
“for to-night we may go a-searching for dead friends by
torchlight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two dragons of war were trailing their coils
nearer to one another. The King’s red banner came
tossing up the slope, he himself riding before it, holding
his shield aloft with the lions of gold thereon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Simon, <span class='it'>je vous défie</span>!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was his cry that morning, a cry that his men
took up, and screamed at the silent masses that watched
and waited on the slopes above. The royal host was
flushed now and confident, trusting in their numbers
and in the great lords whose banners blew everywhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edward the Prince was the firebrand that morning.
He was pricking his horse to and fro like a mad boy,
and his lips were bloody under his great helmet. For
he had the Londoners before him, those Londoners who
had thrown offal and foul words at his mother. The son
had taken a vow to wipe out those words with blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Trumpets rang out on the King’s right. Edward
threw his spear into the air, caught it, and stood up in
the stirrups.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death to the dogs! At the gallop, sirs, come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was away, a splendid and furious figure, with
many thousand horses trampling at his heels. The iron
ranks roared, and rocked and thundered. Those who
watched saw a tossing sea of horses’ heads, a whirl of
hoofs tearing the grass, a mist of slanted spears, a confusion
of grotesque heads bending behind painted shields.
The mass plunged in on the Londoners like a rock that
falls with a deep sob into the sea. There was no submerging
of that mass of steel, and flesh, and leather.
It went in and through as a fire leaps through dry corn,
terrible in its red ruin, unquenchable and splendid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse, on her waggon, caught her breath, and held
it. Simon’s left wing was wavering. Its spears went
down in long swathes, and did not rise again. Black
puffs of panic started out from the rear of the shaken mass,
and spread like smoke over the green hillside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Londoners have had enough! The fools always
suffered from too much tongue. Dirty dogs, run, run,
the devil is at your heels.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had hold of Denise’s arm, and Denise drew her
breath in with a short, sharp sound, for Marpasse’s nails
had made blood marks under the skin. But Marpasse
never so much as noticed that she had hurt Denise.
Her heart was a man’s heart as she watched the Earl’s
left wing streaming away in rout with the mailed knights
and men-at-arms scudding through it, and spearing the
burghers as they ran. Away down the slope of Offham
Hill, and across the level towards Hamsey and Barcombe
went the tide of slaughter. The flying Londoners trailed
a fatal lure for Edward the Prince that morning. The
paradox proved true in the main, that by running away
they won Earl Simon the battle, for Edward hunted them
for a league and a half, wiping out the insults they had
thrown at his mother. And while he trampled the Londoners
into the grass, and drove many of them into the
river, Earl Simon won the battle of Lewes, and taught
Prince Edward a lesson in the self-restraint of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reckless assurance that possessed the King’s
army betrayed itself in an incident that followed the
routing of Simon’s left wing. A crowd of women had
followed on the heels of Edward’s lords and gentlemen,
their lovers of the night before. The women had come
out prepared to enjoy the battle as a spectacle, and
perhaps to gain their share of the plunder. Some of
them were mounted on mules and palfreys, others went
on foot. And no sooner had the Londoners been driven
off the field than these bona-robas came laughing and
shouting up the hill, waving their kerchiefs and making
a great to do. Most of them followed in the track of
Prince Edward’s victorious banners, though a few spread
themselves abroad to plunder the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse and Denise had a distant view of all that
happened after the flight of the Londoners down Offham
Hill. They saw the massive centres of the two hosts
come to grips, and stand like two bulls with locked horns,
neither able to budge the other. Then Earl Simon’s
genius gleamed out. Reinforcing his right wing with
the reserve, he fell upon the left of the royal army under
Richard, King of the Romans, crushed and scattered it
in rout. Turning, he fell furiously with his flushed troops
on the exposed flank of the King’s centre, broke through
their ranks, and gave Gloucester’s men their opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From that wild mêlée the royal centre streamed
away like ragged clouds driven by the wind. The green
hillsides were covered with savage and furious figures,
charging, and counter-charging with a riot of colour and
glittering harness that sank slowly towards Lewes town.
Henry, who had had his horse killed under him, and was
wounded, was dragged away in the thick of a knot of
desperate men, and carried off at a gallop to the Priory
of St. Pancras. The battle was over as a struggle between
two great masses of men. It dwindled into a series of
scattered episodes, and of wild scuffles that rose suddenly
like small dust storms, and then dispersed. A few of
the sturdier spirits fought it out before they surrendered,
happier in their valour than the King of the Romans
who took refuge in a windmill and was besieged by a
mocking and exultant mob till he delivered up his sword
to Sir John de Befs. The fighting flowed in scattered
trickles down to Lewes town, the west gate was taken
by assault, though the King’s men held out in the castle
and in the Priory of St. Pancras.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now those about De Montfort’s standard were so
taken up with watching the rout of the King’s army
that they were caught open-mouthed when one of the
last episodes burst on them like a thunderclap. There
was a shout, the scream of a trumpet, a quivering of
the earth under the thundering hoofs of galloping cavalry.
Prince Edward was riding back from the slaughter of
the Londoners, assuming the battle won, having spent
precious hours in hunting down mere lads amid the windings
of the Ouse. He and his men burst in among the
waggons and the baggage, hot and bloody, their horses
covered with sweat. And since Simon’s standard and
litter were there, they thought they had him in their
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young William le Blund was cut down under De Montfort’s
banner, and his men slain and scattered. The servants
and camp-followers fluttered and flew like frightened
chickens in a farmyard. De Montfort’s litter was overturned,
and the London merchants dragged out by the
heels, and put to the sword despite their babblings and
their protestations. It was shouted abroad that Simon
was hiding somewhere amid the baggage, and the camp
was turned into chaos, men tearing the loads out of the
waggons, thrusting their swords into trusses of fodder,
yelping like dogs about a fox’s hole. The women who
had followed them shared in the scramble. And since
that traitor Simon was not to be found, the whole rout
took to plundering the baggage, not troubling to discover
that the battle had been lost down by Lewes town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse had dragged Denise out of the empty
waggon, and set to at once to pull bales out of a cart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Play the game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had to scream at Denise because of the uproar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Play the game. Swear, curse, be one of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise fell to, and helped Marpasse. The big woman
had whipped out her knife, and slit the sacking of the
bale she had dragged down over the tail board. The
bale contained nothing more than rolls of white
cloth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse spat on it, and swore, for other men and
women were crowding up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“White bibs for the fools, curse them! May Simon’s
corpse be a bloodier colour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She seized Denise by the wrist, and dragged her off
as though to hunt for richer spoil. But in the thick
of the scramble she ran against the chest of a white
horse that came out from behind one of the waggons.
Marpasse saved herself by holding to Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rider on the white horse broke into a shout of
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Great, fat sheep, where are you running?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Marpasse stood open-mouthed, for it was Isoult,
Isoult in a man’s hauberk, and red surcoat, her black
hair bundled up under a steel cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Black cat!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isoult reached down, caught Marpasse by the cloak,
drew her in, and kissed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You big brown devil, how I love the smell of you.
And sister Denise, too, with all the fun of the fair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tossed her head and laughed, and shouted to a
knight on horseback who was watching his men scrambling
over a coffer full of plate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lording, come you here. I have found your red
head for you. Though you will not be wanting her
now, unless you would like a touch of my knife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The knight turned in the saddle; he had taken off
his great helmet, both Denise and Marpasse knew him
at the first glance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaillard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse took Denise by the hand, and kept very
close to Isoult’s white horse.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XL</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery had searched the hillsides that day for a blue
surcoat shining with golden suns, but since Gaillard had
charged among Prince Edward’s spears, he was miles
away on the heels of the Londoners while the men of
the White Cross were driving the King back in rout upon
Lewes town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Simon had not forgotten to look for the return
of the Prince. He had gathered the pick of his knights
and men-at-arms together, and when they brought him
news of the plundering of his camp, he smiled and bided
his time. Steady and motionless, a mass of steel half
hidden by a rise in the ground, De Montfort’s cavalry
waited in the evening light for the coming of the Prince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And a riotous and disordered troop it was that marched
back towards Lewes after plundering the Barons’ camp.
Edward and his lords seemed to have accepted their
victory as assured, and never doubted but that the White
Cross had been trodden into the dust. The scene that
stretched before them, flooded by the evening sunlight,
was deceptive in the extreme. De Warenne’s banner
still flew from the castle, and that of the King from the
bell tower of St. Pancras. There were scattered bodies
of armed men moving over the slopes and about the town,
and the dead strewing the field made no confession of
victory or defeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was then that the most tragic thing of the day
happened, for the mob of fighting men under the Prince,
marching as they pleased, had some hundreds of women
mingled with them, unfortunates who had thought of
nothing but making a joyous night of it after the great
victory, and the plunder that they had won. De Montfort’s
mass of knights and men-at-arms, rising suddenly
like a grey sea out of the twilight, came on at a gallop,
fresh and lusty after a long rest. Isoult was one of those
gay queans, riding with Gaillard’s arm about her, chattering
and laughing to keep her man amused. Following
these two, half as comrades, half as prisoners, came Denise
and Marpasse, mounted upon cart-horses, that had been
taken from the Barons’ camp. Luckily for them they
were in the rear of Prince Edward’s host or they would
have been trampled down at the first charge, as were
many of the women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse and Denise were riding close together,
watching Gaillard as sheep might watch a dangerous dog,
and waiting their chance to break away in the gathering
darkness. Although he had an arm about Isoult’s body,
Gaillard’s eyes wandered round towards Denise, stealing
half-furtive glances at her, as though he were already tired
of Isoult, and suffered his passions to embrace a contrast.
Marpasse saw how it was with Gaillard, and hated him
for Denise’s sake, and because she could tell what manner
of man he was, insolent, lustful, ever ready to throw aside
things that had sated him. He was like a great lean
spider with his long legs and his sinewy arms, and Marpasse
could have stabbed him for the way he held Isoult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were crowded together, and Marpasse and Denise
saw nothing of the storm that was tearing down upon
the Prince’s following. A strange silence fell suddenly
on that mass of humanity, broken here and there by a
loud and querulous cry. A moment ago there had been
nothing but singing, shouting, and coarse jests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shudder seemed to pass through the whole mob.
It wavered, stood still, swayed to and fro. Marpasse
heard women shrieking. Then a roar of voices rose,
the furious voices of men caught at a disadvantage with
death rushing upon them like a flood. Utter confusion
spread, trumpets screaming like frightened beasts, spears
swaying this way and that. Then the shock came.
The bodies of men were thrown in the air like stones
torn from a sea wall by a furious wave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse saw Gaillard rise in his stirrups, draw his
sword, and turn a bleak, wolf-like profile towards them.
He caught his battle helmet from the saddle bow, dipped
his head into it, and came up a grotesque monster with
a face like a gaping frog. Marpasse had a vision of sloped
spears pouring down on them through the golden haze
of the evening. Then chaos seemed to come again, and
the world crumbled with the rushing of many waters
and the rending of solid rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse had a glimpse of Denise clinging to her
horse that had reared in terror. Gaillard had left Isoult,
and was trying to clear a path with his sword, making
his horse swerve to and fro in the press. Then Marpasse
had no sense left in her, but the sense of falling, of being
thrown hither and thither, of being trampled on and
hurt. A horse crashed to the ground close to her and
lay still, and with the blind instinct of the moment,
Marpasse flung herself down and huddled close under the
beast’s body as an Arab shelters behind a camel when a
dust storm sweeps the desert. Yet with swiftness and
tumult and fierce anguish the storm passed, and was
gone. Marpasse found herself peering up over the horse’s
body, and looking at a splendid sky against which dark
figures struggled together as on the edge of an abyss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse scrambled up, wondering how she had come
out of the storm so easily, and stood and stared stupidly
about her, dazed for the moment by the violence of it
all. A tempest of horsemen was rolling away over the
hillside like a grey cloud curling over a mountain. Broken
bodies lay everywhere, some still squirming like worms
that have been trodden under foot; others motionless,
contorted, and grotesque, like bodies thrown at random
from a high tower. And where life and noise and movement
had been but a few minutes before, a slow silence
seemed to ooze in and to stagnate under the melancholy
of the coming night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse’s wits came back to her, and she looked round
for any sign of those who had been with her a few moments
ago. Gaillard had gone, Denise also, like people swept
off a rock by an ocean wave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Looking about her, Marpasse saw a white horse lying
dead upon the hillside, and something that moved half
under and half beside it, with the whimpering cry of a
child. Marpasse stumbled forward, for one foot had been
bruised, and found Death sitting upon the carcase of the
white horse. Isoult lay there with the beast’s body upon
her legs, and her back broken. She could stretch out
her hands to Marpasse, with a shuddering spasm of cursing
that was piteous and futile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curse Simon, and his bulls, curse Gaillard, the
great coward! I am done for, and this white hog, this
devil’s bitch lies on my legs like a rock. Hold off, great
fool. Do I want to be pulled about when my back’s
broken, and my ribs are pricking my liver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse tried to drag her clear of the horse, but
Isoult’s screams and curses sobered her. She saw that
Isoult was near her end, crushed like a wild cat in the
steel jaws of a trap. The girl, too, had the spiteful valour
of a cat, and pushed Marpasse’s hands away when she
tried to fondle her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of your spittle,” she said, biting her lips with
the anguish in her; “it is jolly, I tell you, to be trampled
into the dirt! Just the sort of end I was made for.
Who cares? Oh, yes, I shall go straight to hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She chattered on at random, laughing, sneering, and
biting her lips. Marpasse sat by her, her heart full of
inarticulate and half-angry pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you sitting there for, great fool? There
is that red-headed Denise of yours; you left me for her;
I know, Gaillard told me the story. Oh yes, you had
what you wanted, Messire Gaillard, you held me in your
arms, devil; you saw me trampled on, and rode after
the red head. God curse you, my Gaillard, you bundle
of burning straw in a body of clay. Tell me, Marpasse,
are not we women accursed fools?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She began to curse Gaillard bitterly under her breath.
Marpasse saw a change come over her, for she seemed to
grow thinner and greyer in the dusk. A great sob
gathered in Marpasse’s throat. She fell a-weeping, and
hung dearly over Isoult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, child, what does it avail? Lie in my arms
now, and fall asleep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isoult ceased her cursing suddenly, and shuddered a
little as she felt Marpasse’s tears falling upon her face.
Her black eyes became dark, and very wistful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you weeping for, great fool?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse hung over her, and smoothed her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were a little slip of a thing when we first were
friends,” she said, “and you often slept in my bosom.
We had rough days and rough weather together. All
the roads were rough for us, and so is the last
track.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isoult lay very still, though her cold hands crept up,
and rested in the warmth between Marpasse’s breasts.
She grew very grey and feeble, and blood came into her
mouth. Isoult spat it out, and looked up at Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a fool of a world,” she said hoarsely; “but
if I could work a miracle, I would just mend you, and
set you on your feet. And if God and His saints are
harder hearted, let them keep their pride, I would rather
sup with the devil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isoult gave a great sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could I help it all,” she said; “I was branded
when I was born, and I was no man’s child. No one
ever taught me prayers, or fed me on white bread. And
when I was kicked, I learnt to scratch back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse lay down beside her, and in a little while the
end came. Nor did Isoult die easily, but with pain and
revolt, and blood choking her throat. Marpasse put her
arms about her, and held her till she died. And with the
passing of Isoult’s spirit, something seemed to break in
the heart of Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dusk deepened, and the living woman was sitting
there with her head between her hands, and staring at
the dead woman’s face, when a gaunt man in the dress of
a priest came by, and seeing them, turned aside. He
had a wooden cross in his hand, an axe thrust into his
girdle, and a buckler at his back. If Grimbald had
served the White Cross with his axe that day down
amid the windings of the Ouse, he had put the iron aside
now, and taken to compassion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke to Marpasse, but she did not hear him.
Grimbald touched her on the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace, sister,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse jumped up and looked Grimbald over in
the dusk. Her glance lighted on his cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the use of that,” she said; “bah, take it
away, my brother!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald nodded his head. Marpasse spread her
arms, and then pointed to Isoult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See, there, what has God to say to such a thing?
When we are born in a ditch, and kept in a ditch, and
kicked into a ditch at the end, what has the Cross to
do with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald knelt down quite solemnly, and looked at
Isoult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a child! Who said that she had sinned,
sister?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse’s mouth was full of scoffing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have stones thrown at us. We are too black
for the good folk to soil their hands in washing us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald turned his face to her, and his eyes shone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Lord said ‘let those who are without sin cast
the first stone.’ What do you make of those words,
sister?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That the devil must put his tongue in his cheek
when the good people go to church,” said Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald got up, and went and stood in front of
Marpasse. They looked each other in the eyes like two
sturdy souls sure of hearing the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you see her in eternal flames, sister?” asked
the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On my oath, I do not. The child had good in her,
when people did not thrust thorns into her face.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald nodded his head solemnly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would have the flaying of all hypocrites,” he
said, “as for such lives, I would mend them in
heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will put up a prayer, Father. I have money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald almost glowered at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will my tongue do any better for the stuff! Help
me to pull the child away. We can find her a clean grave
somewhere. As for my prayers, God knows the ways of
the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse had an impetuous heart. She took Grimbald
by the girdle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could kiss that mouth of yours, Father,” she
said, “because it talks out straight, and is the mouth of
a man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The river Ouse took toll that evening from the King’s
host, drawing many a rider into its deeps, while the bogs
and the morasses opened their slimy mouths for food.
The Prince had saved a portion of his following from the
rout upon the hillside, and breaking away he found the
west gate of Lewes held against him, and was compelled
to gallop round the town to join the King at the Priory
of St. Pancras. The greater number of the royalist
leaders had fled, riding for the castle of Pevensey, whence
they could cross into France. The King’s brothers,
William de Valence and Guy de Lusignan, were galloping
for their lives, and with them a crowd of adventurers
and free-lances who knew that they would be hanged
on the forest trees if the country folk could lay their
hands on them. Hugh Bigot and Earl de Warenne were
with the fugitives. The King of the Romans and his
son, the Scotch nobles, many English lords, and a crowd
of lesser men had been taken by Earl Simon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Denise had been saved by the terror of
her horse from being trampled and crushed like Black
Isoult. The beast had broken through, and fled at a
gallop, with Denise lying out like a child along his neck.
There were other horses galloping about her, some with
riders, many with empty saddles, and one common instinct
seemed to shepherd the beasts together, so that Denise
found herself swept along in the thick of the herd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lying upon her nag’s neck, with her cheek laid against
the coarse coat, and her hair blowing in the wind, Denise
became conscious at last of a black horse galloping beside
hers, stride for stride. At first she saw only the beast’s
head with its red nostrils, and ill-tempered ears laid back,
and the whites of its eyes showing. Then a man’s
figure drew into view, and she had a glimpse of a blue
surcoat with a blur of gold thereon, and a great iron
helmet that gaped like a frog. Denise was no longer
a piece of wreckage carried along in the thick of the
flood. The black horse seemed to know his master’s
mind, and began to guide Denise’s nag as one beast
will guide and rule another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man, who had been sitting stiffly in the saddle,
bent forward and caught the trailing halter of Denise’s
horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold fast, Sanctissima,” he said, “we shall soon be
out of the mill race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise knew that it was Gaillard, but fate carried
her at the gallop, and she was too conscious of the
wind in her ears and the way the ground rushed
under her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I can save you a broken neck,” he went on,
shouting the words through the black cleft in the great
helmet, “I shall deserve your forgiveness. The fools
yonder are rushing like a drove of pigs for the river.
They will drown one another. We will take our own
road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise felt like one falling and falling in a dream.
There was no end to it, and she had not enough breath
in her to feel the finer, spiritual fear. It was impossible to
so much as think in the rush and welter of all those flying,
thundering shapes. Her body was taken up with holding
to the body of her horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drew clear of the main torrent at last, and went
cantering in the dusk over the rolling grassland. Gaillard
was sitting straight in the saddle, and watching a gush
of flame that had leapt up over Lewes town. The King’s
men who still held the castle, had thrown springalds of
fire down upon the houses, setting the thatch ablaze so
that the houses should not cover Simon’s men who were
crowding to the assault. The glare of the burning town
seemed an echo from the red sunset above the western
hills. A distant uproar rose into the twilight, though the
summits of the downs were solemn and still. Denise
felt her horse slacken under her now that they had
turned aside from the rush of the pursuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The power to think and to feel came back to her.
She escaped from the chaos of things to a consciousness
of self, and of that other self beside her. The blind
life-instinct that had carried her over the hills into
the twilight, gave place to a quick, spiritual dread of the
man at her side. She had not seen Gaillard desert
Isoult, and leave the girl to be trampled under foot.
But her own being had a passionate loathing for the
man, a loathing so great that it tempted her to throw
herself from her horse. Her broken and unconscious
body would be nothing to Gaillard, and he would
leave her as a drunkard would leave a broken and
empty jar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard, alert and masterful, reined in suddenly as
though to listen. He had caught some sound following
them out of the dusk, but the trampling of their own
horses had smothered it, and robbed it of significance.
Gaillard kept his hold of the halter of Denise’s horse,
and towered over her as he turned in the saddle to look
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ridge of a hill ran bleak and sharp against a
stretch of yellow sky. And outlined against this streak
of gold came the figure of a man riding a black horse.
He was not two hundred paces away, and Gaillard saw
him shake his sword.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise also saw that solitary rider black against the
sunset, and the heart leapt in her, and beat more
quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard kicked in the spurs, dragging Denise’s rough
nag after him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold fast,” he said, “if that fellow is after us, he
will not rob a Gascon of his supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were galloping again, rushing on into a vague
and dolorous dusk. The wind swept Denise’s hair, and
once a shout followed after them, but Gaillard kept her
horse at the gallop, and Denise was at the mercy of the
two strong beasts, and of that yet stronger beast, man.
A streak of dull silver parted the darkness in front of
them. Before Denise had understood the nature of
the thing before them, water was splashed over her,
and their horses were swimming the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard had not spoken a word. When they were out
of the muddy shallows and on the firm ground beyond,
he reined in, turned the horses, and looked back over
the river. An indistinct figure loomed out of the dusk
with a scamper of hoofs, and the heavy breathing of
a hard-ridden horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard had drawn his sword. He lifted his helmet,
and putting it on the point of his sword, stood in the
stirrups, holding sword and helmet high above his head.
Denise was near enough to see his face in the dusk. It
was half fierce, and half amused, yet wholly confident,
the face of a strong man and a libertine whose strength
made him take a bully’s joy in cheating weaker men of
their women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, there!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pursuer had drawn in on the farther bank, with
his horse’s hoofs sucking the spongy grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep over there, my friend, if you value a sound
skull. I am not to be meddled with when I ride with a
gay lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a splashing of hoofs in the shallows, and
a voice came over the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise!” it said, “is it Denise, yonder?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard looked down at her, and opened his mouth
scoffingly when she answered the man’s call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, Golden-head, you would have a lover in your
lap, eh! We will see to it to-night, my desire. I promise
you it shall not be the fool yonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The water had broken into fresh ripples that came
lapping among the sedges. Aymery’s horse was swimming
the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard dropped his great helmet on to his shoulders,
and holding the halter in the same big hand as held his
sword, turned the horses, and rode off so close to Denise
that his knee touched hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Grace before meat,” he said, laughing under his
helmet, “your man is probably clumsy enough. I
know how to deal with such a windmill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dragged Denise’s horse to a canter, and turning
in the saddle, saw Aymery floundering up through the
crackling shadows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some people are in a great hurry to get to heaven,”
said Gaillard; “it is a pity, Sanctissima, that you have
such a head of hair, and such a body. They are things
that make a man cut other men’s throats.”</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XLI</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The plunge through the cold Ouse freshened Aymery’s
horse, and Gaillard, who rode only to put some miles
between him and Simon’s host at Lewes, heard the
rhythm of the hoofs behind him drawing ever nearer. The
knowledge that he was chased by one man did not bustle
the Gascon in the least, for Gaillard knew his own strength,
and had never taken a thrashing. The day’s battle had
beggared him, and his brother adventurers, for the lords
who had hired them would soon be scattered over the
sea. Moreover Gaillard remembered De Montfort in
Gascony, and that Earl Simon had dealt very roughly
with hired gentlemen of the sword who meddled where
they had no cause. Yet Gaillard did not snap his jaws
at the chance that had beggared him. He felt in fettle,
and ready for a scrimmage, arrogantly confident in himself,
and with sufficient animal spite in the mood to
put him in an excellent temper. He would thrash the
fool who followed them, have his way with Denise, and
make Pevensey on the morrow, and sail with some of
the King’s lords who were seized with a desire to visit
France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had Gaillard had a glimpse of the face of the man
who followed him, he might have taken the escapade
more grimly, and talked less of “Sussex boors who could
better fix a spiggot in a barrel than handle a sword.”
The Gascon could not keep the froth from the surface.
Loquacity was a habit of his when he had anything
strenuous in hand. He gabbled away to Denise as they
cantered on in the dusk, keeping a sharp eye however
on the ground before him, very wide awake in spite of
his loquacity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, now, Sanctissima,” he said, “tell me when
you are tired of your horse, and we will stop and talk
to the gentleman behind us. A gallop at night makes
one sleep more soundly. We shall find a bed somewhere,
and no one shall wake you early if you would play the
sluggard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise, listening to the rhythm of hoofs behind them
in the dusk, hated Gaillard for his flamboyant spirit
and his arrogance. She held her breath for Aymery’s
sake. If Gaillard should kill him! If she should see
him beaten, and crushed! She cast frightened brown
eyes over Gaillard’s figure, and hated him the more
because he seemed so big and lusty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo, we are coming up fast behind there!
The gentleman is very hot, and in a great hurry,
Sanctissima! Do you see a wood over yonder. We
can make a bed under the trees when we have had
our talk with Messire Mead-horn. Beer, Sanctissima,
makes these boors hot in the head and quarrelsome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise felt the canter slacken, for Gaillard was drawing
in. A swift and inarticulate horror, a vivid sense of
what was to follow, seized on her. These two men
would be at each other’s throats. And in the dusk and
the silence of that night in May she might see lust conquer
and strangle love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dull plodding of hoofs behind them beat a measure
in her brain. She would have cried out to Aymery,
and could not. And on that hard, brown face under
the helmet she imagined a callous and self-assured
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They neared the trees, masses of fresh foliage
hanging motionless under the quiet sky. It would
be peaceful, and odorous, and silent in among those
trees. Yet their black plumes had a sinister sadness
for Denise. They were so calm, and black, and
motionless, with never the sound of a night wind in
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard reined in abruptly, threw a sharp glance
over his shoulder, and then pushed Denise roughly from
her horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try to run, my minion, and I will ride over you,”
he said, “no fool of a mesne lord shall stand in the way
of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He still had her horse by the halter, and Denise saw
him jerk it, so that the beast tossed its head. And the
brutal thing that Gaillard did sickened her to the heart,
so that she stood still with wide eyes and quivering
mouth. For Gaillard had slashed the horse’s throat,
and Denise saw the poor beast rear, break free, and then
sink on its knees with a smothered sound that was all
too human.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise forgot even the maimed horse with the coming
of Aymery out of the dusk. Gaillard had circled round
so that he stood between Denise and the trees. He had
begun to sing some southern song, throwing his sword
from hand to hand, his voice reverberating in his
helmet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise stood and watched and waited as though her
whole soul had withdrawn into her eyes. Aymery was
quite close to her, yet she neither moved nor spoke to
him. Perhaps she was dazed by the imminent dread
of what would follow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard broke off his song, drew his shield forward,
and crowed like a cock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, my little gentleman,” he said;
“there you are, white cross and all. I will put a red
mark on that cross of yours. Ladies are always pleased
by a red rose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery said nothing, but glanced aside at Denise.
Then Gaillard came cantering up, tossing his sword,
and crowing in his helmet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up with your shield, my friend, I have a lady to
love, and the night is ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise watched them, half in a stupor. The men
were sword to sword, shield to shield, and horse to horse.
Confusedly, like one half asleep, she heard Gaillard
prattling as they began the tussle, a grim and half playful
babble, like the chatter of a waterfall when men are
struggling in the pool beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soon, however, Gaillard grew very silent, save for
a sudden and spasmodic oath. To Denise there seemed
nothing in the world but two strong men lashing at each
other from the backs of two ever moving and circling
horses. Then in the thick of the clangour, and the heavy
breathing, she heard Gaillard give a sharp, fierce cry,
the cry of a strong man cut beneath his harness. A
horse swerved, stumbled, and rolled over. Whose,
Denise could not tell for the moment, in the whirl of the
tussle, and the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Gaillard’s horse, but he was free of the beast,
up, and no longer the complacent sworder, but a man
fighting with the valour of a beast that fights to live.
He blundered against the other’s horse, grappled a leg,
and twisted Aymery out of the saddle. They were on
foot now, still close to her, dodging, striking, circling round
and round. Denise could hear the sound of their breathing
above the rattle of blows, and the dull rustling of
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she saw a man stumble, jerk forward, and
recover though cut across the shoulders with a sword.
A head was bare, the great helmet had fallen, and a white
face showed in its stead. Denise knew Gaillard by his
greater height. His shield was up, sure as a pent-house
at the foot of a wall, and Denise would have crushed
that shield had the power of a Greek goddess been hers
that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gaillard had blood on his face, she saw the
dark smirch thereof above the eyes and down
one cheek. A broken shield was thrown aside,
Aymery’s, and fell like a dead crow with flapping
wings into the grass. Gaillard sprang on him. There
was a meeting of swords, a moment’s locking of the
blades, a swift up-thrust by the one that first broke
free. Again Denise heard that great cry of Gaillard’s
with more of the roar of the wild beast in it than
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rolled from side to side as though drunk, and
then throwing aside his shield, made a blind and blundering
charge with an upheave of the sword. Aymery
sprang to the right with a twist of the body, using
that swing of the body for the sweep of the counter-blow.
Gaillard sprawled, spun round, caught Aymery’s
ankle, and dragged him to earth. For a while there
was a confused struggle in the grass. Denise heard a
man groaning, and straining like a giant trying to lift
a rock that is crushing him into the ground. Then
there was the sharp sound of steel wrenching its way
through steel. The end had come, and one of the
men lay still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why the horror of the thing should take possession
of her as it did Denise did not consider. She saw the
wood, dark, cool, and still, before her, and fled into
it, seeing nothing but hearing ever Gaillard’s cry.
And though she fell often, stumbling against the
great trees in the darkness, she ran like one without
reason, not noticing whether anyone followed, and that
the silence of the place closed on her like water over
a stone.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XLII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>From a chance word that Marpasse let fall while they
were burying Isoult, Grimbald discovered all that she
knew concerning Aymery and Denise, and he made her
tell the story. Marpasse had been breaking up the
ground with a sword, and Grimbald using a shield for a
shovel, scooped a shallow trough for the body wrapped
in its scarlet surcoat. That labour together over the
grave, and the way Grimbald made her talk of herself
and Denise, brought Marpasse and the parish priest to a
sudden sense of comradeship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Isoult laid to rest they trudged off together to
Lewes town, but could gain no sure news of Aymery there,
though Grimbald found a Sussex man, Geoffrey de St.
Leger, who swore that the Knight of the Hawk’s Claw
had ridden in that last charge against Prince Edward’s
company. Grimbald and Marpasse had already searched
the ground in the dusk without coming upon Denise’s
grey gown. A truce had been called, and torches were
moving to and fro over the battlefield like corpse candles
in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The parish priest and the bona-roba watched the
night out under a hedge, and Marpasse fell asleep while
Grimbald watched. They were up before dawn, however,
and breaking bread as they went, they searched the
scarred track along which Simon’s knights had ridden in
pursuit of the flying royalists. Grimbald bent over
many a body in the twilight, and though there were
women lying dead and stiff upon the grass, Denise was
not among them, nor did they find Aymery among the
slain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dawn was just breaking when they came to the
river; grey fog hung there; and it was very still. The
dead were here also, horse and man, and Grimbald saw
that the richer bodies had been plundered, even stripped
naked and left upon the grass. Their search had lessened
the chances, save what the grey river might be hiding
under its shroud. But Grimbald chose to be an optimist
that morning, and swore, as though he had seen the
thing in crystal, that neither Aymery nor Denise was
under the quiet water. He chose the simplest explanation,
and put it forward so confidently that Marpasse believed
also, and fell in with his plan. Aymery had found
Denise, and taken her away with him out of reach of the
storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As sure as I live,” he said, “we shall find them at
Goldspur. It is not the first time that I have prophesied
the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Marpasse accepted Grimbald as a prophet,
and he looked the part with his gaunt face and fiery
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were walking towards the bridge when a splashing
sound came up the river, and a black boat glided out of
the mist, driven along by a man who wielded a long pole.
A second man was drawing in a rope, and there was
something at the end thereof, for the rope was taut and
straight, with drops of water falling from it. The first
man shipped his pole, and went to help his comrade with
the rope, nor had either of them noticed Grimbald and
Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A thing that glistened rose to the surface. The men
reached over, and between them, dragged the body of a
man in gilded harness into the boat. They grunted
cheerfully over the catch, and disappeared below the
gunwale. The boat lay in mid-stream, and there was
the plash of the grapnel as one of the men heaved it out
again into the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald held up a hand to Marpasse, slipped down
the bank, and dropped quietly into the water. A few
long strokes carried him under the boat’s stern. And
the great brown head that appeared suddenly over the
gunwale so scared the two spoilers of the dead that they
gaped at Grimbald, and lost the chance of knocking
him back into the river. The bottom of the boat was
littered with plunder from the bodies along the bank;
and one of the men was cutting the rings from the hands
of the knight they had fished up with the grapnel. Grimbald
scrambled in, axe in hand. But he looked so huge,
and fierce, and fateful in the grey of the morning that the
men jumped for it, and swam like water rats, leaving the
parish priest lord of the spoil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald poled the boat to the bank, lifted the dead
man out, and laid him on the grass. He knelt and said
a prayer for him, while Marpasse stood on guard with the
axe, watching the two thieves who had crawled out on the
near bank and were skulking behind a bush. Grimbald
ended his prayer, and stood up and shook himself like a
great dog.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Providence is at work here,” he said; “my prophecy
will come true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They climbed into the boat and ferried across, watched
by the men who were waiting to recover their spoil. But
Grimbald cheated them of their desire, for he stove out
the planks with the end of the pole, and pushed the
boat out to sink in the deeper water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let it return to the dead,” he said. “Those rogues
shall catch no more fish to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald and Marpasse set out on their five-league
trudge to Goldspur, both of them being stout walkers,
and eager to come to the end of the tale. These two
warm, rough natures were quickly in sympathy, for
Grimbald discovered the “woman” in Marpasse, and
being nothing of the Pharisee he had no exquisite dread
of soiling his robes. Marpasse talked to him on the
way as she had never talked to a man before. Grimbald
was so strong and so honest that the woman’s eyes gleamed
out at him approvingly. Isoult’s death had stirred her
deeply, following as it had on her comradeship with Denise.
Marpasse put her life in its crude and simple colours before
Grimbald’s eyes, not justifying herself, but talking as
though it helped her to talk to a priest who understood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is just like climbing a ladder,” she said, “to get
inside a castle. The good people above throw stones,
and potsherds, and boiling oil. And if you get to the top—they
try to pitch you down again. If I had my way
I would have a door in the side of the world, and the
poor drabs should be let in quietly, and put out to work to
earn their bread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes it is very dull—being good,” said Grimbald
with a twinkle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is often very dreary being sinful, Father. Give
me a chance to choose, and I would have a fire-side, and
a bed, and a broom to use, and a man to cuff me—at times—if
he kissed me an hour afterwards. A smack on the
cheek does a woman a world of good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a kiss on the mouth?” asked Grimbald.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, that makes the puddings turn out well. And
I have a taste for puddings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald’s prophetic instinct fulfilled itself that
morning, for they were not a mile from Goldspur village,
and following a track that ran over a stretch of heathland
between the woods, when they saw a man ride out
from a woodland way. He was not a furlong from them,
so near that they could see the red stains on the white
cross sewn to his surcoat, and the way the reins were
slack upon the horse’s neck. In fact, the horse seemed to
carry the man, and not the man to guide the horse. It
was Aymery himself, grey-faced, battered, forlorn as a
ship struggling home after a storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald’s long legs left Marpasse far behind.
Aymery smiled at him as a sick man smiles at the face
of a friend. He had grown gaunt and haggard in a night,
and the unshaven stubble on his chin showed black against
his pallor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Victory at Lewes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald took his bridle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a wound—somewhere,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wounds—plenty of them. I am tired, Grimbald—tired
as a dog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery left his horse to the priest, for it was as
much as he could do to steady himself in the saddle by
holding to the pommel with both hands. Marpasse came
to meet them, and Aymery looked at her stupidly, as
though his brain were clouded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A faint gleam passed across his face as he recognised
Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have killed him,” he said; “yes—it was on the
edge of the woods—over yonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He relapsed again into a half stupor, staring at Marpasse
with eyes that seemed heavy with sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise?” she asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He echoed her, slowly. Marpasse nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise was with Gaillard—I killed him. She had
disappeared when we had ended it,” and he looked at
Marpasse as though it was she who was wise in the matter,
an appealing look like the appeal of a dumb child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald gave Marpasse a most unpriestly wink.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bed and bread,” he said in a whisper, “and good
wine to wash it down. The oil is low in the lamp. Keep
it burning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse understood, and was all cheerfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never was I better pleased by the thought of a
corpse,” she said; “as for Denise, she was born to run
away—as I always tell her. She knows the woodways
hereabouts, Father, eh? To be sure. Madame will not
be long on the road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery was at the end of himself, and lay along his
horse’s neck, his arms hanging down on either side.
Grimbald looked fierce, being combative where death,
sickness, and the Devil were concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum—white as a clean dish clout!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse touched Aymery’s cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Asleep,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak out; no metaphors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I speak what I mean—and your long words can go
to the eel pond, Father. He is asleep. What could be
better? Gaillard, Messire Gaillard, you met your match!
And Denise—the fool—ran away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went close, kissed Aymery’s neck, and then
turned on Grimbald with a defiant glare of the eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mayn’t I kiss a brave man?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald threw up his head and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who said you ‘nay’?” he retorted; “you women
are in such a hurry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I shall kiss you, Father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you!” quoth he grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Goldspur manor house was still a mute gathering of
charred posts, though some of the lodges and the barn
had been rebuilt. Aymery was taken that day to the
priest’s house that stood on the edge of a glimmering
birch wood, whose boles rose like silver pillars above the
brown wattle fence about the church. Grimbald carried
him in in his arms, and laid him on his own bed. There
was no <span class='it'>focaria</span> or servant, and Marpasse was soon as busy
as any hearth-ward. She found the aumbry where
Grimbald kept his oil and wine, gathered sticks from
the wood lodge, lit a fire, and hung the iron pot on the
hook. Grimbald was stripping Aymery of his harness,
unfastening the gorget and greaves, peeling the heavy
hauberk off him with much trouble, and unlacing the
gambeson beneath. Marpasse came in with the wine
and the water-pot, for Grimbald had his bed in the little
room at the end of the great hall. She began to covet
and handle some of the parish priest’s vestments that
hung on pegs along the wall. Marpasse’s brown hands
made a white alb scream into strips for bandages.
Grimbald glanced round at her with philosophic
consent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall never get such another,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I put up an oath for you, Father?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiet, fool! His mother gave it me—five years
ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has washed well,” said Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the alb was used to bind up Aymery’s
wounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Much loss of blood from a few deep flesh cuts, that
was the main mischief, and Grimbald and Marpasse soon
had him under the coverlet. He was half asleep all the
while they were handling him, heavy and stupid with
long hours in the saddle, the death tussle with Gaillard,
and lack of food. There was no epic heroism in the
episode. Aymery was put to bed like a small boy, and
the washing that Marpasse had given him had made the
illusion more complete. Beyond making him drink some
wine they did not trouble him, but left him to have his
sleep out, and wake—if God willed it—hungry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse’s thoughts turned to Denise, but she and
Grimbald were sufficiently carnal to rejoice in a good
round meal of bread and mead and bacon. They sat at
the table with the door of the house wide open, so that
they had a glimpse of the green and mysterious world
beyond. Grimbald had little to say, and Marpasse was
very hungry, and so little overawed by a seat at a priest’s
table that her hunger walked boldly, and would not be
abashed. And Grimbald was amused by it, and commended
the healthiness of the instinct, the more so
because it proved its value in the person of a very comely
woman with a sunburnt face, clear eyes, and a mass of
tawny hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They began at last to talk of Denise, and Marpasse
made Grimbald take her to the door, and point her out
the way to the beech wood where Denise had had her
cell. Grimbald could show her the wood itself, a green
cloud adrift across the blue of the May sky. Marpasse
saw to her shoes, dropped half a loaf into her bag,
and made it plain to Grimbald whither she was
going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Birds fly back to the same haunts in the spring,”
she said; “nor do I see, Father, why you alone should be
a prophet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald looked at her as a wise man of five and
forty looks at a mischievous yet lovable girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go—and prove it,” he said; “I shall get down to
the village and send the people out to search the woods.
Not a word to them—mind you—of all that has happened
in the past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse showed the curve of a strong brown
chin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I so much a fool?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald appeared to consider the question. He
did not give his verdict till Marpasse had reached the
gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death alone saves us from being fools,” he said, and
his eyes had a seriousness as he watched her go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse went down the hill, leaving the village on
her left, and crossing the valley, climbed the slope to the
great beech wood. The trunks were black and smooth
under a splendour of green that shone in the sunlight.
The earth still seemed virginal, for the flowers that had
been touched by the bees were lost in the rich, rank lustiness
of early summer. The valleys rippled with gold,
and the may trees were still in bloom, and full of infinite
fragrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse made her way through the wood, and came
at last to the place where the beech boles stood like great
pillars about an open court. There was a blur of colour
against the green, the pink blush of an early rose that
had run in riot over the wattle fence, and flowered like
a rose tree in a garden of Shiraz. The dark brown thatch
of the cell showed ragged holes where birds had burrowed
in and built their nests. The grass stood knee deep in
the glade, grass that seemed asleep in the warm sunlight,
dreamed over by moon-faced daisies bewitched by the song
of the bees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse had taken cover behind the trunk of a
beech tree. She had seen a track in the long grass where
someone had passed but a short while ago. And Marpasse’s
eyes beamed in her brown face. Her prophecy
had also been fulfilled, for there, under the shade of the
rose tree she saw Denise amid the grass, her knees drawn
up, and her chin resting in the palms of her two
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse watched her awhile, indulging her own philosophy
much like a nurse commenting upon a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heart of mine, but somebody should be here in my
place. What a sad, white face, to be sure, and what eyes—as
though the whole world were on its death bed! We
will change all that, my dear. You shall be the colour
of the rose bush before the day is out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She slipped from behind the tree, and crossed the
grass, singing a song that she had often sung upon the
road. And she saw Denise’s face start up into the sunlight
out of its mood of mists and sadness. A tendril
of the rose tree caught Denise’s hair as Marpasse pushed
open the rotting gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse laughed, happy, yet with a lovable shyness
in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See what it is to be desired,” said she, “even the
rose tree must catch at that hair of yours. Heart of
mine—how you tremble!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took Denise and held her, kissing her mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you ran away—for the last time, hey—when
St. George had finished slaying the dragon! That was a
mad thing to do, my dear. You should have stopped to
succour him, should he have been wounded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise’s brown eyes searched Marpasse’s face, looking
beyond the other’s playfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gaillard?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dead, heart of mine; the best thing that ever he
did was to die. Those brown eyes of yours need not look
so frightened, St. George has been put to bed to sleep
till he is hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse sat down under the rose tree, and drew Denise
into her lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try to smile a little, my dear,” she said, “for summer
is coming in, and the cuckoo is singing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise did not rest long in Marpasse’s lap, nor would
she touch any of the bread that Marpasse had brought
with her. She drew aside in the grass, turned her face
away, and sat staring into the shadowy spaces under the
trees. Marpasse watched her, and let the mood take its
course. She could be patient with Denise as yet, knowing
that suffering and sorrow leave the heart sore and easily
hurt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise spoke at last in a low voice, still keeping her
face hidden from Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is he?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down yonder—in the priest’s house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wounded?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He killed Gaillard, heart of mine, and Gaillard was
a good man at his weapons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her vagueness did not work as a lure. Denise did not
swoop to it; so Marpasse told the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing to fear. Messire Aymery was not
born to die a bachelor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does he know that I am here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How should he, heart of mine, when I left him
asleep—tired out, and came up here at a venture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise fell again into a long silence. There was something
in the poise of her head—and in the way she sat
motionless in the long grass that betrayed troubled
thoughts and deep self-questioning. Denise had the
mirror of her life before her, and found it full of shadows,
and of reflections that she could not smother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marpasse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heart of mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He must never see me again; no—I could not bear
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God help us now! Why, it is the month of May—and
the sun is shining——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the truth, Marpasse. How can I—I——?
Look; it all happened here! How can I put that out of
my heart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse stretched out a hand and touched her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, come, look at the sun, not at the
shadows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not in me—to forget everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even that the man loves you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise turned on her suddenly with eyes full of a
fierce light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and should I take his love, I—who cannot go
to him as a woman should! It is not in my heart, Marpasse,
whatever you may say. God help me, but I love
him better than that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her passion spent itself, and she lay down in the grass,
covering her face, and trying to hide a rush of tears.
Marpasse bent over her, moved by great pity, and yet
impatient with Denise for pulling so simple a thread
into a tangle. But Denise would not listen to Marpasse.
She was even angry with her own tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no—let me be; I am a fool; it will soon pass.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse grimaced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why will you walk on thorns?” she said; “some
people can never satisfy their consciences!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise still hid her face in the long grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is for Aymery’s sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bah!” quoth Marpasse; “you will give him a
stone, will you—when he is hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She got up from under the rose tree, and went towards
the gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have left you the bread,” she said, “and it is better
to eat bread and be contented than to look for rents in
one’s own soul. Messire Aymery shall not know that
you are here, if you will promise me one thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise raised herself upon her elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stay here till to-morrow. I will put it all before
Father Grimbald. He is a man with a head and a heart.
For the rest, my dear, put that bread into your body
and sleep ten hours by the sun.”</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XLIII</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery was still in a deep sleep when Marpasse returned
to the priest’s house an hour before sunset, and
found Grimbald baking cakes on the hearth. Marpasse
might have laughed at his housewifeliness had she not
been in a very earnest temper about Denise. So she
drew a stool up and sat down as though to make sure
that Grimbald did not burn the cakes which he had made
while she was away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have found her,” she said, and Grimbald had only
to listen, for Marpasse’s generous impatience had ample
inspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never tell me women are not obstinate, Father, for
I swear to you that Denise was born to make misery for
herself. A Jew hunting for a farthing in the mud is not
more careful than Denise to hunt out something to
grieve over. I should like to cut the conscience out of
her, and bury it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald held up a hand, and rising from the
stool, went to the doorway of the inner room, and
looked in to see that Aymery was asleep. He closed
the door softly, and came back to the hot cakes and
Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a great battle-horse, my child,” he
said bluntly. “Denise’s flanks are not for the same
spur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse took the rebuke with the best of tempers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear Lord, but the pity of it. All this to-do, and
blood-spilling, and no marriage bed at the end of it.
There is no law of the Church against it, Father, surely?
The monks clapped vows on her, and pulled them off again
with their own hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald bent forward, and methodically turned
the cakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His strong face shone like burnished copper in the
firelight; a gaunt, good face, honest and very shrewd.
Marpasse watched him, and the thought flashed on her
from somewhere that it would be an excellent thing to
have the baking of such a man’s bread. And with a
quaint impulsiveness she put her hand up over her
mouth, symbolising the smothering of so scandalous a
conceit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having turned all the cakes, Grimbald gave his judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no love for the convent women,” he said,
“and there—I am out of fashion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse saw the worldly side of the picture, and
smoothed away a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you would make them man and wife, Father
if the chance offered?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Against all the monkish law in the kingdom,” he
said stoutly; “we put no vows on her when she had
her cell up yonder. And some of the folk here would
have been burnt for her if she had asked it. Only that
lewd dog of a Gascon——Well, we broke their teeth at
Lewes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse stared solemnly into the fire as though
looking for pictures amid the blaze of the burning
wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Denise could only forget a year,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald nodded wisely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God wastes nothing,” he answered; “those who
never suffer, never learn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery slept the whole night, and woke soon after
dawn with a rush of memories like clouds over a March
sky. He found Grimbald sitting by his bed. Grimbald
was dozing, but his eyes opened suddenly and looked
straight at Aymery like the eyes of an altar saint in the
dimness of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first word that Aymery uttered was the name of
Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald’s gaunt face remained thoughtful and
placid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marpasse has found her,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s eyes asked more than Grimbald had the
heart to tell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is safe,” was all that he would say, and acting
as though there were no secret to be concealed, he
went out to lay the fire on the hearth of the great
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Marpasse showed a most managing temper that
May morning, and went about as though she had some
grave work on hand. She herself took food in to Aymery,
remained awhile with the door shut, and came out looking
very set about the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have told him a lie,” she said to Grimbald in a
whisper, “his eyes asked for it. Go in and barber him,
Father; a lover looks best with a clean chin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald stared her in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you told him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That we kept her away last night—for the sake of
his wounds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald’s lips came together for a “but.” Marpasse
whispered on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get your razor and barber him, Father, and keep
a clean edge on the lie. His eyes asked for it—I tell you,
and I had not the heart to dash in the truth. I have the
yoke on my own shoulders. Two lies sometimes make
the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took Grimbald’s holly staff from the corner,
and put on her hood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to fetch her,” she said; “no—I shall
not scold. I have my plan. You may sit in the wood-shed
out of sight, Father Grimbald, when I bring her
back with me. If she sees you it will spoil the whole
brew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned on the threshold, and Grimbald saw
suddenly that her eyes were wet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray for them both, good Father,” she said to him,
“my heart’s in the thing whatever rough words my
mouth may say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Grimbald promised, and let her go. Yet when
she had gone, and he was left alone in the great
room with its black beams and smoking hearth, he
saw through his prayers the brave, brown face of
Marpasse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Marpasse’s warm-hearted, yet coarser, nature could
not vibrate to the subtler emotions that stirred in Denise.
The two were like crude sunshine and moonlight; Marpasse
healthy and vital in herself, yet lacking mystery
and the glimmer of visionary things. Denise had often
been more a spirit than a body, though the woman in
her had been awakened, and the rich warm scent of the
earth had ascended into her nostrils. Suffering had
made her very human, and yet the soul in her still beat
its wings, even though those wings should carry it away
from the world’s desire nearer to the cold stars in a lonely
sky. To Marpasse, Denise’s self-condemnation might
seem a kind of futile and pitiable sanctity, but then
Marpasse had more blood and bone in her, and less of
that spirit that is crucified by its own purity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise had passed the whole night in the long grass
under the rose tree, looking at the stars and the vague,
black shapes of the great beeches. The cell had a horror
for her, and she would not enter it, as though her other
self lay dead within. That other memory was more
vivid than the memories of those nights when Aymery
had lain there wounded little more than a year ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Give herself to the man she felt she could not, for
she was too sensitive, too much a sad soul in a beautiful
body not to feel the veil of aloofness that covered her
face, that veil that was invisible and impalpable to
Marpasse. Her own innocence made her more conscious
of that other life—that other innocent soul that had
been born in her, and which had taken from the mother
that which she would have given to Aymery whom she
loved. Only a pure woman could feel what Denise felt
in her heart of hearts. The divine girdle had been torn
from her. Love might be blind to it, but Denise’s soul
could not be blind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet a sense of great loneliness rushed upon her
that night, weighing her down into the long grass, and
making her heart heavy. The petals of the rose fell dew
drenched into her lap. The night was still and fragrant,
and no wind made the trees mutter like the hoarse whisperings
of an oracle in some ancient forest. The heart of
Denise was heavy within her. The sad deeps of life
seemed between her and the world, a dark voiceless gulf
that no living soul could cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the day came, and with it Marpasse, holly staff in
hand, alert, and on her guard. But she was disarmed
that morning by Denise herself. The first glimpse of that
tragic and troubled face drove the rougher words out of
Marpasse’s mouth. She took Denise in her arms, and
kissed her, seeing in those brown eyes such deeps of
sincerity and sadness, that Marpasse humbled herself,
feeling herself near to something greater than a woman’s
whim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse guessed what Denise had to say. The
renunciation lay in the brown eyes like a dim mist of
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going away, Marpasse,” she said. “I have
thought of it all the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse hid her impulses, and was patient and very
gentle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heart of mine, where will you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Earl Simon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse opened her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall go to him, and put everything before him.
He has a great heart, Marpasse, and his lady has
the soul of Mary—Our Mother. Nor shall I go in
vain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She spoke very simply, like one resigned, but Marpasse
felt the wild heart of a woman who loved palpitating
beneath her courage. It was the purpose of one whose
knees shook under her, and who strove to keep herself
from looking back. A touch, and love would break out,
with a great passionate cry. Marpasse saw it all, and
took her inspiration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So be it, heart of mine,” she said, looking sad enough;
“and yet—before you go—there is Father Grimbald
yonder. The good man strained a sinew last night,
or he would have been here with me this morning.
He would not forgive your going without seeing
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise breathed out the answer that Marpasse was
expecting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I cannot go! He—is there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse, brazen-faced, told the lie of her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Messire Aymery? He is so little the worse that
he was in the saddle at daybreak, and searching the
woods to the west, and half the village with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise looked into Marpasse’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heart of mine, why should I tell you a lie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise seemed to hesitate. She shrank from the
sight of any familiar face that morning, and yet her
heart reproached her because of Grimbald. The thought
was often with her that she might have trusted him
more deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse, dreading to seem too eager, put in a frank
plea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why shun a good friend?” she said; “he would
be grieved. The man is no Ursula, God forbid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise surrendered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will come,” she said; “but I will see no one but
Grimbald.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave it to me, sister; we can keep to the woods.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse played her part so well that no flicker of
suspicion passed over Denise’s face as they made their
way across the valley to the priest’s house under the
silver birches. Only here and there had they to leave
the woodlands to cross a meadow or a piece of the wild
common where the villagers pastured their cattle. Denise
walked with her hood drawn forward, looking about her
wistfully at the hills and valleys that were so familiar,
and had been so dear. She felt like a stranger in the
Goldspur woods that morning, a bird of passage that
passed and left no loneliness in the heart of the land she
left. Marpasse talked much upon the way, entering
into Denise’s plans as though she were resigned to them,
the most loving of hypocrites who lied for the sake of love.
She even warned Denise to take care of her long-suffering
body. “Two nights without sleep,” she said, “is enough
for any woman. Live your life in such a hurry and you
will be as thin as a post in three months, with wrinkles
all over your face. The pity of it! Like a piece of fine
silk left out in the wind and rain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they came to Grimbald’s house amid the silver
stems of the birches, Marpasse alert and on the watch
lest some piece of clumsiness should make her plot miscarry.
Denise was shy and wild as an untamed falcon,
her brown eyes half afraid of the birch wood, as though
Aymery might come riding out with half Goldspur village
at his heels. Marpasse saw the look in Denise’s eyes.
One clap of the hands and the bird would be skimming
on frightened wings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Courage, sister,” she said, “there is not a soul to
be seen. I will keep guard and watch while you are
talking with Grimbald. No, the good man will not try
to over-persuade you. If I whistle, then you will know
that there is danger in the distance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They entered the porch, Marpasse first, Denise following.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The good man is abed resting that sprained ankle
of his. I will see whether he is ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse crossed the outer room, peeped in, held up
a hand to Aymery, and turned and called Denise. There
was an iron catch on the door that hooked into a staple,
so that the door could be fastened on the outer side.
Moreover the door opened outwards into the larger
room, and Marpasse stood with her hand on the
catch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is coming, Father,” she said, keeping her eyes
upon Denise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grey figure brushed past Marpasse, and crossed
the threshold in all innocence. No sooner was Denise
within, than Marpasse clapped to the door, fastened it,
and ran like a mad woman out of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the wood-shed at the end of the rough garden
she found Grimbald sitting patiently on the chopping
block behind a screen of faggots.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have shut her in with him,” she said; “now love
must win—or never.”</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XLIV</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The morning sunlight poured through the window and
struck upon Denise as she stood leaning against the door
that Marpasse had closed on her. The first impulse had
been one of anger, the anger of one caught in an ambuscade.
For it was not Grimbald that she saw, but
Aymery, propped against a pillow, with a face like wax,
his eyes shining at her, eyes full of that truth which she
had sought to shun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He held out his hands to her, rising in the bed so
that the sunlight fell upon his head and shoulders. And
Denise, leaning against the door, found her anger sinking
into a kind of stupor. Her face was as white as Aymery’s,
and she shrank like a bird when the hand of the fowler
comes into the trap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s eager face was still luminous, as though the
soul shone through the flesh. Denise’s hood was drawn,
yet beneath it he caught the gleam of her splendid hair.
She did not move or utter a word, but stood there helplessly,
hearing her own heart beating like a thing that
struggles to be free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sudden sense of a shadow stealing across
the room. The man’s face had clouded. A troubled,
questioning look came into the eyes, the look of a dog
trying to understand. His hands sank slowly to the
bed, and were no longer stretched out to her, but lay open,
palms upward, the hands of a man waiting for alms from
heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the moment Denise saw nothing but those hands.
The rush of blind anger against Marpasse went out before
a spasm of compassion. The silence of the room seemed
the silence of a great church where the Holy Blood is
uplifted. Then a mystery of infinite, dim things swept
over her like a cloud of incense. She shivered, and held
her breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She struggled to find words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought that it was Grimbald here. Marpasse
deceived me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How poor and miserly the words seemed, and the
sense of their ineffectual coldness drove her to glance at
Aymery’s face. He was lying back in the shadow, his
eyes watching her with that same puzzled, questioning,
and wistful look. She saw them fill suddenly with
understanding, and the generous gleam that followed,
humbled her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did not know——” he began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marpasse told me——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bit her lips, and was silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise—it was no trick of mine, God knows
that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leant against the door, hiding her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I lost you—after Gaillard and I had ended it. They
brought me here, and told me that they had found you,
but that they would not bring you to me—because of my
wounds. That—is everything. Call Marpasse. She
shall open the door and let you go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Denise glanced at him, half furtively, and that one
glance seemed to make the metal of her purpose melt
and flow into a stream of living fire. She turned with
an inarticulate cry, and threw back her hood, letting the
sunlight fall upon her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, how can I, I who remember all the past!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was up, leaning towards her, stretching out his
hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God! What is all that—to me! Can you not
understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She swayed, closing her eyes, her hands feeling the
air as though she were blind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My heart—oh—my heart!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Denise!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May the sin of it be forgiven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was on her knees beside the bed, her arms flung
out over it, her face hidden in the coverlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord—save me——!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery’s arms went round her, and she clung to
him with sudden passion, as though life were there, and
love, and hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold me—keep me—let me not go! Oh, but the
shame of it—the selfishness! Closer, closer to you!
I am afraid—I am afraid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was trembling like one lifted from the torture of
the rack. Her hands clung to him, the hands of a
frightened child, and of an impassioned woman. Aymery
turned her in his arms, so that her hair fell down across
the bed, and her face was under his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rest here, my heart. Who—on God’s earth—shall
take you from me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their eyes met and held in one long look.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord, lord—ah—do not pity me,” she said, “not
in the way that hurts a woman’s heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aymery kissed her upon the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God forgive me,” he said, “if ever I have made
you think that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Marpasse had returned, leaving Grimbald
in the wood-shed, and creeping softly across the room
she stood listening at the closed door. Such a true
friend was Marpasse that the two within might have forgiven
her her eaves-dropping. It was no inquisitive
spirit that waited there silent, and open-mouthed,
listening with wet eyes to words that were sacred.
Marpasse soon knew the truth, and she crept away on
tip-toe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Marpasse was no sooner out of the house than a
delirious mood seized her, and she ran like a girl, her wet
eyes ablaze, her face exultant. There was no need for
Grimbald to ask her how things sped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love is lord of all,” she sang; “and I have the
weight of a lie off my shoulders! Good saints, good
saints—I wish I could give you a lapful of silver!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed up to Grimbald in her delight, caught him
by the shoulders, and kissed him full upon the mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mea culpa</span>, Father; I am a mad fool, but my heart
was in the venture, and when I am glad—like a dog—I
must show it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sunlight pierced the faggot wall of the shed,
and burnt like golden tongues on the sombre cloth of the
man’s cassock. Something in Grimbald’s eyes sobered
Marpasse abruptly. It was not anger, not an amused
and fatherly tolerance, but a look in which the deep
strong heart of the man betrayed itself. Marpasse
caught her breath, and went fiercely red under her brown
skin. Then, a sudden virginal softness seemed to steal
over her face. She hung her head, but not foolishly.
For the moment neither she nor Grimbald spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse gave a short, curious laugh, picked up a
rotten stick, and began to snap it into small pieces between
her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May they be very happy,” she said; “the love of a
strong man is life to a woman, Father—and the children
that may come of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up quickly at Grimbald, and her bold
eyes had grown like the eyes of a girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might have made a good mother—but there——!”
and she threw the pieces of broken wood aside, and spread
her hands “children have not come my way—nor the
man who will master me,” and she was silent, staring at
the ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grimbald’s face shone like a rock with the sunlight
on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To some of us such things are not given,” he said;
“my children are down yonder—and yet——! I chose
what I chose—when I was a lad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marpasse seemed to be struggling to say something
that would not shape itself into words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is so lonely—sometimes,” and her eyes looked into
the past; “dear heart, I have often spat at the thought
of myself! It is always ‘the might have been,’ with
some of us. The world often leers at a woman, Father,
when it offers her a penny. I was just as tall as the
harvest wheat when they pushed me out on the road.
But I am not bad to the core, Father, though few people
would think it the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She heard Grimbald draw his breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The core of the world is a generous heart,” he said;
“look at me, Marpasse. Many things might happen,
but for what I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took Marpasse’s hands, held them a moment, and
then dropped them reverently, looking at her to see
that she understood. And these two brave souls gazed in
each other’s eyes, knowing that they could come no
nearer, and that their lives might cross but never travel
the same road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Marpasse went out from the wood-shed into the
sunlight with a smile upon her face, the smile of a woman
who has re-discovered mystery in herself. A look of the
eyes, a few words, a touch of the hands—that was all!
Marpasse pressed her face between her two hands, and
stood staring and staring away towards the distant woods.
The scoffing voice was silent in her, the mouth strangely
soft, the eyes the eyes of a young girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Denise, who kissed her that night, as a woman
who is loved kisses the woman who loves her, saw no
shadow of sadness on the brave, brown face of Marpasse.</p>
